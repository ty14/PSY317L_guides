# Basic Syntax

We kind of need to know at least a tiny bit of syntax before we move forward...


keep it very simple.


## boring mathematical stuff

R is, first and foremost, a statistical programming language. So, unsurprisingly, you can do a bunch of mathematical operations fairly easily. Let's do some really tedious math:


You can add with the `+` key:

```{r}
4 + 6
```

You can see that the output returned `10` indicating that that is the answer to `4 + 6`.  However, we also see in the output a `[1]` before it. What does this mean?  This is an index - which we'll talk about in more detail later- but essentially all it is telling us is that the number that comes directly after it is the first bit of the output. We only have one thing in our output here - the number `10`, so it's pretty pointless - but it does have relevance in the future.  For now though, you can safely ignore it.






Subtracting uses a hyphen or minus key `-`:

```{r}
43 - 18
```

Multiplying uses the asterisk `*`:

```{r}
5 * 3
```

Dividing uses this slash key `/`:

```{r}
34 / 7
```


You can square root like so by typing `sqrt()` and putting your number to square root in the brackets:

```{r}
sqrt(45)
```


Squaring a number requires us to use the cute `^` key followed by a number `2` to indicate that we are raising to the power 2 (which is squaring):

```{r}
12^2
```


*Our first little warning*

Like all programming languages, R will only do what it's told. One thing that catches people out is that it will read code in order from left to right.  So, if you're doing several things at once, you may need to insert brackets to make sure that it does what you want it to.  For instance, say you want to multiply 5 by the sum of 7 and 9.

You might write that like this:

```{r}
5 * 7 + 9 
```

but `44` is not the answer you're looking for!  What it has done is to take 5, then multiply it by 7 (makes 35) and then add 9 to make 44. 


OK, how about you write it like this instead:

```{r}
7 + 9 * 5
```

Erm, this time it multiplied 9 by 5 to get 45 and then added 7 to make 52.  What is happening is that some mathematical operations are taking precedence over others and R does things in certain order. To explicitly make sure that it does what you want, insert some brackets like this:


```{r}
5 * (7 + 9) 
```

Now it **knows** that what you wanted to do was to add 7 and 9 to get 16 and have that number multiplied by 5 to get 80.  This sort of thing is something to look out for, but as you get experienced you'll have a sense for it. Well placed brackets can save you a headache.





## assignment
e.g. what the assignment operator is.

This symbol `<-` which is just a "greater than sign" followed by a "hyphen" is called an assignment operator. It basically is equivalent to saying you want to save something.  You write what you want to be saved on the right hand side of it, and the name of your newly saved thing on the left of it.  We call the 'thing' that you've saved an 'object' in programming speak.

For instance, say you wanted to save the number `17`, and you wanted to call that saved number an object called `x`. You'd do it like this:


```{r}
x <- 17
```

Now, whenever you type, `x`, R thinks that it is the number 17.


```{r}
x 
```






We should probably fess up right now and tell you that there is another way that you can assign things in R. On the face of it, it's a much easier way too, but we're going to recommend you don't do it. The only reason that we're bringing it up at this point is that if you look up help on the internet or in some books, you'll see people doing it - so we should mention it.

You can assign using the equal key `=` like this:

```{r}

y = 10 - 2

y
```

So, as you can see, we created an object called `y` that was equal to 10 minus 2, that is 8. Using `=` seems so much easier than using `<-` so what is the reason not to do it?  Well, the equal sign gets used for a ton of other commands and sometimes it gets a little messy and confusing if too many equal signs fly around.  Thefore, we're going to politely ask that whenever you assign things, please use the `<-` operator, even though it's two bits of punctuation stuck together:

```{r}

hooray <- 17 + 4  # thanks for using this sign
hooray
```



## vectors

Of course, you can save even more complex things as the object. For example, if you wished to save the numbers `5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`, you have two ways of doing that.  Let's just see them in action, and then we'll explain the syntax:

```{r}

v1 <- 5:10

v1

v2 <- c(5,6,7,8,9,10)

v2

```


As you can see both `v1` and `v2` are our newly saved objects and they both contain the numbers 5 through 10.  For `v1` we separated the numbers 5 and 10 with a colon `:`.  In R, the `:` sign can be used to mean "to" when talking about a series of numbers. e.g.

```{r}
5:10

101:103
```


The other way we did it with `v2` was to use the `c()` function. This stands for `concatenate` which is a mouthful.  Basically, it's a way of sticking things together.  You write `c()` and then put the stuff you want to stick together inside the brackets, but make sure you separate each thing by a comma `,`.  For example,

```{r}
c(1,10,100,1000)

c(4,6,8,10,8,6,1)

```


Another bit of terminology might be worth mentioning right now.  Our saved objects `x`, `v1` and `v2`, as well as being called `objects` can also be called `vectors`.  A vector is something in R that contains several items. These items are actually called `elements`.  Importantly the items are indexed, which means that they are in order, not all jumbled up.  That means that you can directly grab an element by it's position.  So, if you wished to get the first element (or item) of the object `v1` you'd type like this:

```{r}
v1[1]
```

That returns '5' which was our first element we put into the vector.

If we wish to get the 3rd element of `v1` we'd do this:

```{r}
v1[3]
```

And, if we wished to get the first, second and third element of `v1` we'd do this:

```{r}
v1[1:3]
```


blah blah blah

I just remembered that if you don't want the image to appear inline, then you leave out the ! from the markdown syntax.

Now, one of the great advantages of vectors is that you can do things to all of the numbers inside the vectors at once.  For instance, say we wanted to square all the numbers inside of `v1`, then all we need to do is:

```{r}
v1^2
```

and notice how it squared the numbers 5 through 10 that are the contents of `v1`.


You can also do things to the entire contents of a vector at once.  For instance, if you wanted to add up all the numbers in `v1` you could do this by using the function `sum()` like this:

```{r}
sum(v1)
```

and it added 5+6+7+8+9+10 to give one answer!
