# Descriptives

Descriptive statistics describe basic features of the data in simple summaries such as mean, median, and mode. These statistics used to present quantitative descriptions of data in graphing. You can use functions in base R and `tidyverse` to get descriptive statistics. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

atx <- read_csv("data/austin_weather.csv")

head(atx) # first 6 rows
```


## Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation

```{r}
mean(atx$temp)
median(atx$temp)
sd(atx$temp)

```

## Other descriptives 

```{r}

length(atx$temp)
var(atx$temp)
range(atx$temp)
min(atx$temp)
max(atx$temp)

```


## Inter-quartile Ranges 

``` {r}
quantile(atx$temp, .25)  # this is the lower quartile
quantile(atx$temp, .75)  # this is the upper quartile
IQR(atx$temp)   # this is the inter-quartile range.

```
