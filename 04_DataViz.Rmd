# Data Visualization 

The package `ggplot2` is used to visualize data. Before starting you should load the `tidyverse` package, which includes `ggplot2` and other tools, at the very top of your script. 

See example below.
You need to do it once for every script.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read in data 
``` {r}
covid <- read_csv("data/countycovid.csv")

head(covid)
tail(covid)
```
