# Data Visualization 

The package `ggplot2` is used to visualize data. Before starting you should load the `tidyverse` package, which includes `ggplot2` and other tools, at the very top of your script. 

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Intro to ggplot2

Read in data

```{r}
df <- read_csv("data/BlueJays.csv")
```

Start with a black canvas 

``` {r}
ggplot()  
```

Just adding the datset to the blank canvas, but nothing plotted yet.

```{r}
ggplot(df)   
```

You need to  use aes() for every ggplot you make, and inside aes() we'll put what our x and y axis will be. 

We say what the x and y are, and it creates scales on each axis, but we didn't tell it what to plot yet.

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=Mass, y=Head) )   
```

Need to add points. 
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=Mass, y=Head) ) + geom_point()
```

What if we want to change the color of the points?
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=Mass, y=Head) ) + geom_point(color='red')
```


What if we want to color the points based on another variable
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=Mass, y=Head, color = KnownSex) ) + geom_point() 
```

Basically, you can just keep adding to the initial plot to make your graph the best visualization to fit your data. 


There are many different graphs you can make with `ggplot`. What graph you make will depend on what type of data you have and what you want to visual from your data. 

The next couple sections will take the base of ggplot and show you examples with different types of points. They will start general then show you how to customize plots. 

General information about customizing plots in ggplot:
 1. change the type of points you plot with `geom_point(pch = blah)`:

Also, you can change the color and size of points by `geom_point(size = 3, color = "blue"). 


2. Built in themes: 

theme_bw() 
a variation on theme_grey() that uses a white background and thin grey grid lines.

theme_linedraw() 
A theme with only black lines of various widths on white backgrounds, reminiscent of a line drawing.

theme_light()
similar to theme_linedraw() but with light grey lines and axes, to direct more attention towards the data.

theme_dark()
the dark cousin of theme_light(), with similar line sizes but a dark background. Useful to make thin colored lines pop out.

theme_minimal()
A minimalistic theme with no background annotations.

theme_classic()
A classic-looking theme, with x and y axis lines and no gridlines.

theme_void()
A completely empty theme
