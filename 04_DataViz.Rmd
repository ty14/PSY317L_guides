# Data Visualization 

The package `ggplot2` is used to visualize data. Before starting you should load the `tidyverse` package, which includes `ggplot2` and other tools, at the very top of your script. 

See example below.
You need to do it once for every script.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Histogram 


## Scatter


## Boxplot 


## Adding details
