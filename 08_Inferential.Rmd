## Effect Sizes

Just because you observe a “significant” difference in means between two groups doesn’t mean that it’s interesting or relevant….  


i.e. being ‘significantly different’ doesn’t tell you how *BIG* the difference is – i.e. how *LARGE* the effect size is.

The formula for Cohen's $\delta$ is as follows:

$\Huge \delta = \frac{\overline{X}_{1} - \overline{X}_{2}}{\hat{\sigma}_{\rho}}$
