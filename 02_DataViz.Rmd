# Data Visualization 

The package `ggplot2` is used to visualize data. Before starting you should load the `tidyverse` package, which includes `ggplot2` and other tools, at the very top of your script. 

See example below.
You need to do it once for every script.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Next you need to read in your data!
# ```{r}
# df <- read.csv("")
# ```


# Scatter Plots

# ```{r}
# ggplot(df, (x = , y = )) +
#   geom_point()
#  ```
