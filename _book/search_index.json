["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 Downloading R 2.2 Downloading RStudio 2.3 Another subheader of something 2.4 Importing Data", " 2 Introduction This chapter details how to get started using R. The initial steps are downloading and installing R. This may differ slightly based on your machine. 2.1 Downloading R Go to the R website. The first box has options for downloading R for Mac, Windows or Linux. Click on the appropriate link. Then you will want to click on \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{&quot;install R for the first time&quot;}}\\). Then follow the instructions. 2.2 Downloading RStudio blah blah blah 2.3 Another subheader of something blah blah blah 2.4 Importing Data There are different options for importing data. It's possible to import data of all different formats into RStudio. We will primarily use spreadsheet type files that have been saved with the &quot;.csv&quot; suffix. These are called 'comma separated files'. Option 1. Import Tab You can click on the &quot;Import Dataset&quot; tab in the top right of RStudio - it's located just above your global environment. Tyler - perhaps we can insert images here? like this Of course, we should look into how to chaneg image sizes. You then need to click on the appropriate file type that you wish to import. As I mentioned, nearly all our files will be &quot;.csv&quot; files, so you should click on &quot;From CSV&quot;. In other versions of RStudio, this may say &quot;from text (readR)&quot; instead. blah blah blah I can't remember how to insert more space between sections, so I just write to try and force space. Option 2. Writing code. This is the option that we will use in our scripts for this course. You may notice that all the datasets that we wish to use are in a folder called &quot;data&quot;. To read in any of these datasets, what we need to do is use the read_csv() function. This comes from a package contained with the tidyverse package, so we must have imported that library first. We then tell it which dataset to find within the 'data' folder. We use the notation &quot;data/...&quot; to tell it to look inside the data folder. For instance, if we wished to load in the bmi.csv dataset, and assign it the name bmi, we would do it like this - make sure to put quotes around the whole file name and location: library(tidyverse) #load package ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 -- ## v ggplot2 3.2.1 v purrr 0.2.4 ## v tibble 2.1.3 v dplyr 0.8.3 ## v tidyr 1.0.2 v stringr 1.3.1 ## v readr 1.1.1 v forcats 0.3.0 ## Warning: package &#39;ggplot2&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## Warning: package &#39;tibble&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## Warning: package &#39;tidyr&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## Warning: package &#39;dplyr&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() -- ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() bmi &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/bmi.csv&quot;) # bring in data ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## id = col_integer(), ## age = col_double(), ## bmi = col_double(), ## chol = col_double(), ## insulin = col_double(), ## dbp = col_double(), ## sbp = col_double(), ## smoke = col_integer(), ## educ = col_character() ## ) head(bmi) # first six rows ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## id age bmi chol insulin dbp sbp smoke educ ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 18.3 15.4 47.2 2.78 29.5 49.7 1 D ## 2 2 19.4 14.5 52.1 3.47 31.3 49.0 2 C ## 3 3 21.1 16.0 52.2 4.06 32.4 51.7 1 B ## 4 4 21.3 19.5 53.2 4.48 32.0 NA 2 A ## 5 5 21.1 18.6 55.4 5.34 33.7 53.8 1 D ## 6 6 23.9 19.5 54.3 6.29 35.0 56.0 2 C Tyler.....Perhaps we should either suppress the warnings and messages (which you can do in the r chunk header in markdown)?

["basic-syntax.html", "3 Basic Syntax 3.1 assignment 3.2 vectors", " 3 Basic Syntax We kind of need to know at least a tiny bit of syntax before we move forward... keep it very simple. 3.1 assignment e.g. what the assignment operator is. This symbol &lt;- which is just a &quot;greater than sign&quot; followed by a &quot;hyphen&quot; is called an assignment operator. It basically is equivalent to saying you want to save something. You write what you want to be saved on the right hand side of it, and the name of your newly saved thing on the left of it. We call the 'thing' that you've saved an 'object' in programming speak. For instance, say you wanted to save the number 17, and you wanted to call that saved number an object called x. You'd do it like this: x &lt;- 17 Now, whenever you type, x, R thinks that it is the number 17. x ## [1] 17 3.2 vectors Of course, you can save even more complex things as the object. For example, if you wished to save the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, you have two ways of doing that. Let's just see them in action, and then we'll explain the syntax: v1 &lt;- 5:10 v1 ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 v2 &lt;- c(5,6,7,8,9,10) v2 ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 As you can see both v1 and v2 are our newly saved objects and they both contain the numbers 5 through 10. For v1 we separated the numbers 5 and 10 with a colon :. In R, the : sign can be used to mean &quot;to&quot; when talking about a series of numbers. e.g. 5:10 ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 101:103 ## [1] 101 102 103 The other way we did it with v2 was to use the c() function. This stands for concatenate which is a mouthful. Basically, it's a way of sticking things together. You write c() and then put the stuff you want to stick together inside the brackets, but make sure you separate each thing by a comma ,. For example, c(1,10,100,1000) ## [1] 1 10 100 1000 c(4,6,8,10,8,6,1) ## [1] 4 6 8 10 8 6 1 Another bit of terminology might be worth mentioning right now. Our saved objects x, v1 and v2, as well as being called objects can also be called vectors. A vector is something in R that contains several items. These items are actually called elements. Importantly the items are indexed, which means that they are in order, not all jumbled up. That means that you can directly grab an element by it's position. So, if you wished to get the first element (or item) of the object v1 you'd type like this: v1[1] ## [1] 5 That returns '5' which was our first element we put into the vector. If we wish to get the 3rd element of v1 we'd do this: v1[3] ## [1] 7 And, if we wished to get the first, second and third element of v1 we'd do this: v1[1:3] ## [1] 5 6 7 blah blah blah summary image does the image appear above? I just remembered that if you don't want the image to appear inline, then you leave out the ! from the markdown syntax. summary image "],

A value of 0 indicates that there is no overall relationship. Examples of different slopes image in here... 11.2 Calculating the Pearson Correlation in R To calculate the correlation coefficient in R, it's pretty straightforward. You simply can use the cor() function. For instance, let's correlate... cor(1:10,1:10) # replace with an example ## [1] 1 Before we go further into what we should do with these correlations, and how to signficance test them, let's learn a little bit more about how they come about. 11.3 Cross-products The formula for calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient for a sample is: $r = $ When we have a population, we can use the formula: $r = $ Essentially, the steps are to convert all the X and Y scores into their respective z-scores. Then you mutliply these two values together to get the cross-product. After summing up all the cross-products for each data point, we divide this number by n-1 if we're dealing with a sample (we usually are), or n if we're dealing with a population. The above formula is for a sample. The sum of the cross-products will therefore be largely positive if positive z-scores are multiple together or if negative z-scores are multiplied together. The sum of the cross-products will be largely negative if negative z-scores are multipled with positive z-scores. insert image here. The following example should help make this clearer. Look at the following data, its scatterplot and the correlation coefficient. They show that we have a positive correlation of r=0.84. Let's break it down how we got that value. x &lt;- c(1.1, 1.5, 2.1, 3.5, 3.6, 3.5, 2.6, 5.6, 4.4, 3.9) y &lt;- c(2.8, 2.9, 1.6, 5.5, 4.7, 8.1, 3.3, 7.7, 7.1, 5.8) df &lt;- data.frame(x, y) df ## x y ## 1 1.1 2.8 ## 2 1.5 2.9 ## 3 2.1 1.6 ## 4 3.5 5.5 ## 5 3.6 4.7 ## 6 3.5 8.1 ## 7 2.6 3.3 ## 8 5.6 7.7 ## 9 4.4 7.1 ## 10 3.9 5.8 ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(size=2) cor(x,y) ## [1] 0.8418262 First, let's calculate the means and standard deviation (using sd so a sample standard deviation) of x and y. We need to get these values so we can calculate the z-scores of each. # step 1: Get the mean and sd of x and y mean(x) ## [1] 3.18 sd(x) ## [1] 1.370158 mean(y) ## [1] 4.95 sd(y) ## [1] 2.259916 Now, we can calculate the z-scores, remembering that the formula for that is: $z = $ # step 2. Calculate z-scores of x, and z-scores of y. df$zx &lt;- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x) # z scores of x df$zy &lt;- (y - mean(y)) / sd(y) # z scores of y df ## x y zx zy ## 1 1.1 2.8 -1.5180729 -0.9513626 ## 2 1.5 2.9 -1.2261358 -0.9071132 ## 3 2.1 1.6 -0.7882302 -1.4823557 ## 4 3.5 5.5 0.2335497 0.2433718 ## 5 3.6 4.7 0.3065340 -0.1106236 ## 6 3.5 8.1 0.2335497 1.3938569 ## 7 2.6 3.3 -0.4233088 -0.7301155 ## 8 5.6 7.7 1.7662195 1.2168592 ## 9 4.4 7.1 0.8904082 0.9513626 ## 10 3.9 5.8 0.5254868 0.3761201 Following this, we simply multiple the z-scores of x and y against each other for every data point: # step 3. Calculate the cross-product: zx * zy df$zxzy &lt;- df$zx * df$zy df ## x y zx zy zxzy ## 1 1.1 2.8 -1.5180729 -0.9513626 1.44423785 ## 2 1.5 2.9 -1.2261358 -0.9071132 1.11224399 ## 3 2.1 1.6 -0.7882302 -1.4823557 1.16843751 ## 4 3.5 5.5 0.2335497 0.2433718 0.05683941 ## 5 3.6 4.7 0.3065340 -0.1106236 -0.03390988 ## 6 3.5 8.1 0.2335497 1.3938569 0.32553483 ## 7 2.6 3.3 -0.4233088 -0.7301155 0.30906432 ## 8 5.6 7.7 1.7662195 1.2168592 2.14924036 ## 9 4.4 7.1 0.8904082 0.9513626 0.84710104 ## 10 3.9 5.8 0.5254868 0.3761201 0.19764615 We now have all of our cross-products. Notice why the majority are positive. This is because we have multiplied positive \\(z_{x}\\) with positive \\(z_{y}\\) or we multiplied negative \\(z_{x}\\) with negative \\(z_{y}\\). This happens because datapoints that tend to be above the mean for x are also above the mean for y, and points that are below the mean of x are also below the mean of y. We can add this up to get the sum of the cross-products. That is the \\(\\sum_{}^{} z_{x}z_{y}\\) in the formula. # step 4. Sum up the cross products. sum(df$zxzy) # 7.58 ## [1] 7.576436 We now divide that by n-1 as we have a sample, to get the correlation coefficient r. That gives us an estimation of the average cross-product. # step 5- calculate &#39;r&#39; by dividing by n-1. (for a sample) sum(df$zxzy) / 9 # our n was 10, so n-1 = 9 ## [1] 0.8418262 sum(df$zxzy) / (nrow(df) - 1) # nrow(df) is more generalizable ## [1] 0.8418262 # r=0.84 Just as a quick second example, here is a work through calculating a negative correlation. Notice the \\(z_{x}\\) and \\(z_{y}\\) scores that are multiplied together. They are largely opposite in terms of signs. This is what leads to a negative sum of cross-products and the negative correlation. Why? Because data points that are above the mean for x are generally below the mean in terms of y and visa-versa. ### Example 2.
