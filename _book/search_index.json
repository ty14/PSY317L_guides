Curley &amp; Tyler M. Milewski June 28, 2020 1 Welcome to PSY317! The following is a simple guide to R studio. What this guide contains.... That it's mainly a how to implement stuff in R, but it also touches on bits of stats and data theory where applicable 1.1 What this book includes and what it doesn't This is in between a textbook and a study guide. We're trying to build materials that will enable students to quickly find what they're looking for to help them understand these statistical concepts. This book is primarily aimed at the content in PSY317L (and PSY1XXR), but occasionally we describe concepts that we don't directly cover in these courses. This is when we feel that it's worth explaining things in a bit more detail for those students that want to know a bit more about a subject. 1.2 Acknowledgements This guidebook is built upon the work of several others' teaching materials. In particular, Danielle Navarro's book.... also some examples come from Andy Field's intro to statistics using R 1.3 References The following books are all freely avaiable online (like this one!) and are helpful resources wilke - visualizing wickham grolemund - intro R other wickham books? danielle navarro - intro stats 1.4 Other places to find help about R Rstudio - cheatsheets, community pages ??? 1.5 Other places to find help about R and Statistics With statistics stuff, you can never really have enough resources. Although throughout this course we try to explain difficult concepts in terms we hope all students can understand, sometimes you just need to read or hear about these concepts several times before they sink in. Othertimes, it's not until somebody else explains it in a slightly different way that it finally finds a home in your brain. To that end, we recommend looking over some other help tutorials and reading. You certainly don't have to go looking at these materials - but if you feel like hearing a different voice, then these are some that I recommend. Albert Kim stuff? Andrew Field's statistics in R book - probably the next level up from introduction in terms of R. Khan Academy videos.(not on R though) "],
["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Downloading R 2.3 Downloading RStudio 2.4 Using RCloud instead of RStudio 2.5 Importing Data", " 2 Introduction 2.1 Introduction This chapter details how to get started using R. The initial steps are downloading and installing R. This may differ slightly based on your machine. 2.2 Downloading R Go to the R website. The first box has options for downloading R for Mac, Windows or Linux. Click on the appropriate link. Then you will want to click on \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{&quot;install R for the first time&quot;}}\\). Then follow the instructions. 2.3 Downloading RStudio blah blah blah 2.4 Using RCloud instead of RStudio blah blah blah 2.5 Importing Data There are different options for importing data. It's possible to import data of all different formats into RStudio. We will primarily use spreadsheet type files that have been saved with the &quot;.csv&quot; suffix. These are called 'comma separated files'. Option 1. Import Tab You can click on the &quot;Import Dataset&quot; tab in the top right of RStudio - it's located just above your global environment. Tyler - perhaps we can insert images here? like this Of course, we should look into how to chaneg image sizes. You then need to click on the appropriate file type that you wish to import. As I mentioned, nearly all our files will be &quot;.csv&quot; files, so you should click on &quot;From CSV&quot;. In other versions of RStudio, this may say &quot;from text (readR)&quot; instead. blah blah blah I can't remember how to insert more space between sections, so I just write to try and force space. Option 2. Writing code. This is the option that we will use in our scripts for this course. You may notice that all the datasets that we wish to use are in a folder called &quot;data&quot;. To read in any of these datasets, what we need to do is use the read_csv() function. This comes from a package contained with the tidyverse package, so we must have imported that library first. We then tell it which dataset to find within the 'data' folder. We use the notation &quot;data/...&quot; to tell it to look inside the data folder. For instance, if we wished to load in the bmi.csv dataset, and assign it the name bmi, we would do it like this - make sure to put quotes around the whole file name and location: library(tidyverse) #load package ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 -- ## v ggplot2 3.2.1 v purrr 0.2.4 ## v tibble 2.1.3 v dplyr 0.8.3 ## v tidyr 1.0.2 v stringr 1.3.1 ## v readr 1.1.1 v forcats 0.3.0 ## Warning: package &#39;ggplot2&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## Warning: package &#39;tibble&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## Warning: package &#39;tidyr&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## Warning: package &#39;dplyr&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() -- ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() bmi &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/bmi.csv&quot;) # bring in data ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## id = col_integer(), ## age = col_double(), ## bmi = col_double(), ## chol = col_double(), ## insulin = col_double(), ## dbp = col_double(), ## sbp = col_double(), ## smoke = col_integer(), ## educ = col_character() ## ) head(bmi) # first six rows ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## id age bmi chol insulin dbp sbp smoke educ ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 18.3 15.4 47.2 2.78 29.5 49.7 1 D ## 2 2 19.4 14.5 52.1 3.47 31.3 49.0 2 C ## 3 3 21.1 16.0 52.2 4.06 32.4 51.7 1 B ## 4 4 21.3 19.5 53.2 4.48 32.0 NA 2 A ## 5 5 21.1 18.6 55.4 5.34 33.7 53.8 1 D ## 6 6 23.9 19.5 54.3 6.29 35.0 56.0 2 C Tyler.....Perhaps we should either suppress the warnings and messages (which you can do in the r chunk header in markdown)?

["basic-syntax.html", "3 Basic Syntax 3.1 boring mathematical stuff 3.2 assignment 3.3 vectors", " 3 Basic Syntax We kind of need to know at least a tiny bit of syntax before we move forward... keep it very simple. 3.1 boring mathematical stuff R is, first and foremost, a statistical programming language. So, unsurprisingly, you can do a bunch of mathematical operations fairly easily. Let's do some really tedious math: You can add with the + key: 4 + 6 ## [1] 10 You can see that the output returned 10 indicating that that is the answer to 4 + 6. However, we also see in the output a [1] before it. What does this mean? This is an index - which we'll talk about in more detail later- but essentially all it is telling us is that the number that comes directly after it is the first bit of the output. We only have one thing in our output here - the number 10, so it's pretty pointless - but it does have relevance in the future. For now though, you can safely ignore it. Subtracting uses a hyphen or minus key -: 43 - 18 ## [1] 25 Multiplying uses the asterisk *: 5 * 3 ## [1] 15 Dividing uses this slash key /: 34 / 7 ## [1] 4.857143 You can square root like so by typing sqrt() and putting your number to square root in the brackets: sqrt(45) ## [1] 6.708204 Squaring a number requires us to use the cute ^ key followed by a number 2 to indicate that we are raising to the power 2 (which is squaring): 12^2 ## [1] 144 Our first little warning Like all programming languages, R will only do what it's told. One thing that catches people out is that it will read code in order from left to right. So, if you're doing several things at once, you may need to insert brackets to make sure that it does what you want it to. For instance, say you want to multiply 5 by the sum of 7 and 9. You might write that like this: 5 * 7 + 9 ## [1] 44 but 44 is not the answer you're looking for! What it has done is to take 5, then multiply it by 7 (makes 35) and then add 9 to make 44. OK, how about you write it like this instead: 7 + 9 * 5 ## [1] 52 Erm, this time it multiplied 9 by 5 to get 45 and then added 7 to make 52. What is happening is that some mathematical operations are taking precedence over others and R does things in certain order. To explicitly make sure that it does what you want, insert some brackets like this: 5 * (7 + 9) ## [1] 80 Now it knows that what you wanted to do was to add 7 and 9 to get 16 and have that number multiplied by 5 to get 80. This sort of thing is something to look out for, but as you get experienced you'll have a sense for it. Well placed brackets can save you a headache. 3.2 assignment e.g. what the assignment operator is. This symbol &lt;- which is just a &quot;greater than sign&quot; followed by a &quot;hyphen&quot; is called an assignment operator. It basically is equivalent to saying you want to save something. You write what you want to be saved on the right hand side of it, and the name of your newly saved thing on the left of it. We call the 'thing' that you've saved an 'object' in programming speak. For instance, say you wanted to save the number 17, and you wanted to call that saved number an object called x. You'd do it like this: x &lt;- 17 Now, whenever you type, x, R thinks that it is the number 17. x ## [1] 17 We should probably fess up right now and tell you that there is another way that you can assign things in R. On the face of it, it's a much easier way too, but we're going to recommend you don't do it. The only reason that we're bringing it up at this point is that if you look up help on the internet or in some books, you'll see people doing it - so we should mention it. You can assign using the equal key = like this: y = 10 - 2 y ## [1] 8 So, as you can see, we created an object called y that was equal to 10 minus 2, that is 8. Using = seems so much easier than using &lt;- so what is the reason not to do it? Well, the equal sign gets used for a ton of other commands and sometimes it gets a little messy and confusing if too many equal signs fly around. Thefore, we're going to politely ask that whenever you assign things, please use the &lt;- operator, even though it's two bits of punctuation stuck together: hooray &lt;- 17 + 4 # thanks for using this sign hooray ## [1] 21 3.3 vectors Of course, you can save even more complex things as the object. For example, if you wished to save the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, you have two ways of doing that. Let's just see them in action, and then we'll explain the syntax: v1 &lt;- 5:10 v1 ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 v2 &lt;- c(5,6,7,8,9,10) v2 ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 As you can see both v1 and v2 are our newly saved objects and they both contain the numbers 5 through 10. For v1 we separated the numbers 5 and 10 with a colon :. In R, the : sign can be used to mean &quot;to&quot; when talking about a series of numbers. e.g. 5:10 ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 101:103 ## [1] 101 102 103 The other way we did it with v2 was to use the c() function. This stands for concatenate which is a mouthful. Basically, it's a way of sticking things together. You write c() and then put the stuff you want to stick together inside the brackets, but make sure you separate each thing by a comma ,. For example, c(1,10,100,1000) ## [1] 1 10 100 1000 c(4,6,8,10,8,6,1) ## [1] 4 6 8 10 8 6 1 Another bit of terminology might be worth mentioning right now. Our saved objects x, v1 and v2, as well as being called objects can also be called vectors. A vector is something in R that contains several items. These items are actually called elements. Importantly the items are indexed, which means that they are in order, not all jumbled up. That means that you can directly grab an element by it's position. So, if you wished to get the first element (or item) of the object v1 you'd type like this: v1[1] ## [1] 5 That returns '5' which was our first element we put into the vector. If we wish to get the 3rd element of v1 we'd do this: v1[3] ## [1] 7 And, if we wished to get the first, second and third element of v1 we'd do this: v1[1:3] ## [1] 5 6 7 blah blah blah summary image does the image appear above? I just remembered that if you don't want the image to appear inline, then you leave out the ! from the markdown syntax. summary image Now, one of the great advantages of vectors is that you can do things to all of the numbers inside the vectors at once. For instance, say we wanted to square all the numbers inside of v1, then all we need to do is: v1^2 ## [1] 25 36 49 64 81 100 and notice how it squared the numbers 5 through 10 that are the contents of v1. You can also do things to the entire contents of a vector at once. For instance, if you wanted to add up all the numbers in v1 you could do this by using the function sum() like this: sum(v1) ## [1] 45 and it added 5+6+7+8+9+10 to give one answer! "],

The sample SD is an estimate of the population SD. We need this estimate because we never have data from the full population but only random samples. The formula for population sd is the square root of the variance divided by N, where are the sample sd is the square root of the variance divided by n -1. x &lt;- c(14, 11, 5, 3, 8, 10, 9, 15) pop.sd(x) ## [1] 3.838538 sd(x) ## [1] 4.10357 The is a .3 difference if the standard deviations. However, would the difference be as big with a bigger sample? set.seed(1) # just so we all get the same results x &lt;- rnorm(100, mean = 8) #100 random numbers with mean of 8. pop.sd(x) ## [1] 0.8936971 sd(x) ## [1] 0.8981994 Sample SD is larger than population SD but this difference gets smaller as sample sizes increase. For visual proof that using the population SD underestimates for samples. For the example say we have a population of 1000, with a mean of 199.91 and population SD of 8.28. set.seed(1) population &lt;- rnorm(1000, mean = 200, sd = 8) mean(population) #199.91 ## [1] 199.9068 pop.sd(population) #8.28 ## [1] 8.275186 What if you did not know the real population SD and you were going to take samples of size 15 to try and estimate the population mean and SD. s1 &lt;- sample(population, 15, replace = T) mean(s1) ## [1] 200.7815 pop.sd(s1) ## [1] 9.27111 sd(s1) ## [1] 9.59651 Let's try another sample: s2 &lt;- sample(population, 15, replace = T) mean(s2) ## [1] 202.2548 pop.sd(s2) ## [1] 7.38066 sd(s2) ## [1] 7.639709 So, in one sample the sample SD was closer to the real pop SD in the other, the popSD was closer to the real pop SD. Now let's do this for 10,000 samples: results.means&lt;- vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) results.popSD&lt;- vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) results.sampSD&lt;- vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ s &lt;- sample(population, 15, replace = T) results.means[[i]] &lt;- mean(s) results.popSD[[i]] &lt;- pop.sd(s) results.sampSD[[i]] &lt;- sd(s) } Sample mean, remember the population mean = 199.91 means &lt;- unlist(results.means) # sample means mean(means) ## [1] 199.872 Standard deviations using the population SD popSDs &lt;- unlist(results.popSD) # SDs using popSD mean(popSDs) ## [1] 7.839468 Sample SDs sampSDs &lt;- unlist(results.sampSD) # sample SDs mean(sampSDs) ## [1] 8.11462 Now graph everything! This shows the sample mean is a good etimate of the population mean, on average. ggplot(data.frame(means), aes(x=means)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;black&#39;, fill=&#39;blue&#39;, alpha=.2)+ theme_classic() + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(means), lwd=1, color=&quot;black&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = 199.91, lwd=1, color=&quot;orange&quot;, lty=2) + ggtitle(&quot;Sample Means Distribution&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. However, this shows the population SD formula with samples, leads us to underestimating the real population SD - on average there is a lot of variation though. ggplot(data.frame(sampSDs), aes(x=sampSDs)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;black&#39;, fill=&#39;blue&#39;, alpha=.2)+ theme_classic() + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sampSDs), lwd=1, color=&quot;black&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = 8.28, lwd=1, color=&quot;orange&quot;, lty=2) + ggtitle(&quot;SD Distribution when using Sample SD&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Overall, using the sample SD formula with samples, provides a better estimate of the population SD on average. This is why we divided by n-1 for sample SD. "],

In statistical terms a distribution refers to the range of possible values that can come from a sample space. Another way of stating that is to say that a distribution represents how the probabilities of getting various values are distributed. There are several classic distributions in statistics. There are distributions such as the normal, t, Poisson, bimodal etc. We're going to dig a bit deeper into distributions, in particular the normal distribution. The best way to look at distributions is to plot histograms. Let's look at some distributions. 7.1.1 Uniform Distribution The first distribution we'll look at is the uniform. A uniform distribution is one where there's an equal probability of getting each value from the distribution. In the example below, we've grabbed 1,000,000 numbers from a uniform distribution that starts at 0 and ends at 100. Let's look at it's shape: As you can see, the histogram that we have generated is roughly flat across the top. This means that we have equal frequency counts in each bin. Each bin here is 5 across, so the first bin is 0-5, the next bin is 5-10, and so on. We have 25 bins in total in this histogram, and each has roughly 50,000 values in it. This is the classic shape of the uniform distribution. 7.1.2 Bimodal Distribution Another family of distributions that is worth our attention are bimodal distributions. In these distributions we have two peaks in the distribution. You can see an example below: 7.1.3 Normal Distribution In most domains, the type of histograms i.e. distributions, that we most commonly observe don't have 0 peaks like the uniform distribution or 2 peaks like the bimodal distribution, but have just one peak. These are called unimodal distributions. One such classic distribution that is very important to statistics is the normal distribution. The normal distribution has one peak and is symmetrical, with the same proportion of data on each side of the distribution. In addition, we say that a normal distribution has a skewness of 0 and a kurtosis of 3. We'll talk about what those are a little bit more about what that means very shortly. Let's look at a normal distribution. The following normal distribution has a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 5. We can generate it by collecting 1,000,000 datapoints in R: set.seed(1) x &lt;- rnorm(n = 1000000, mean = 100, sd = 5.0) mean(x) ## [1] 100.0002 sd(x) ## [1] 5.000926 dfnorm &lt;- data.frame(vals = x) p &lt;- ggplot(dfnorm, aes(x = vals)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), color = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;purple&quot;, alpha=.4, binwidth = 0.5) + geom_density(alpha = 0.7, fill = &quot;mistyrose&quot;) + theme_classic() + xlab(&quot;values&quot;) p Normal distributions can vary in their means and standard deviations. Below is an image of a selection of four different normal distributions that all vary in their means and standard deviations. The dotted vertical black line in each graph indicates where their respective means lie. We use special notation to indicate that a distribution is a Normal Distribution. For instance, for the normal distribution that has a mean of 17 and a standard deviation of 7, we would write: \\(N(\\mu=17, \\sigma^{2}=49)\\) which demonstrates that the distribution is approximately normal with a mean of 17 and variance of 49 (which is the standard deviation, 7, squared). Normal Distributions 7.1.4 Standard Normal Distribution Although normal distributions can have various means or standard deviations, there is one case that we reserve and call the standard normal distribution. This is for the situation where the mean of the distribution is 0 and the standard deviation (and the variance) is equal to 1. \\(N(\\mu=0, \\sigma^{2}=1)\\) Normal Distributions How does the standard normal distribution come about? We will discuss more about this distribution in section xxx.xxx, but briefly it is obtained by converting all the values of a normal distribution into z-scores. z-scores are calculated by: \\(z=\\frac{x - {\\mu}_x}{\\sigma_x}\\) This standard normal distribution is very useful in statistics because we can precisely calcualte the proportion of the distribution that is to the left or right under the curve at any point of it. This principle forms the basis of several statistical tests. 7.1.5 Skewness and Kurtosis Above we described that a normal distribution has a skewness of 0 and a kurtosis of 3, but then we just skipped along and didn't really say anything else. It's important to take a quick step back and think about these two things. 7.1.5.1 Skewness We most commonly evaluate skewness for unimodal distributions (those with one peak). The skewness of a distribution can be either negative or positive, or, if it has no skew whatsoever it will be 0. It is probably easiest to describe skewness by looking at examples. In the picture below, all distributions have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 20. However, they differ in their skewness. The one on the left has a skew of +0.68, the one on the right has a skew of -0.68. The one in the middle has a skew of 0 and is the only one that is normally distributed. Skewness Distributions that have negative skew are also called left skewed because their longest tail extends to the left of the distribution. Similarly, distributions that have positive skew are called right skewed because their longest tail extends to the right of the distribution. Another thing to consider about the skew of the distribution is what happens to the mean, median and mode of the distributions. First, let's look at the normal distribution we made earlier in this section that had a mean of approximately 100 and a standard deviation of approximately 5. If we get the median, mode and mean of that distribution, we get the following: mean(x) ## [1] 100.0002 median(x) ## [1] 100.0025 estimate_mode(x) # R doesn&#39;t have a built in mode function, so I&#39;m using this as a proxy ## [1] 100.05 We can see here, that all three values are really close to 100. We can look at this in our plot of the distribution. We've overlaid a red line for the mean, a blue line for the median and an orange line for the mode. However, they all lie on top of each other at x=100, so it's hard to distinguish them: p + geom_vline(xintercept = median(x), color = &quot;blue&quot;, lwd=1)+ geom_vline(xintercept = mean(x), color = &quot;red&quot;, lwd=1)+ geom_vline(xintercept = estimate_mode(x), color = &quot;darkorange&quot;, lwd=1) Now let's look at some skewed distributions as to what happens to the mode, median and mean in such distributions. In this dataset, we have 7486 rows of data (observations). Each row is a MLB player. The three numerical columns refer to the career total hits (totalH), career total at bats (totalAB), and career batting average (avg) of each player. bats &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/batting.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## playerID = col_character(), ## totalH = col_integer(), ## totalAB = col_integer(), ## avg = col_double() ## ) nrow(bats) ## [1] 7486 head(bats) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## playerID totalH totalAB avg ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 aaronha01 3771 12364 0.305 ## 2 aaronto01 216 944 0.229 ## 3 abbated01 772 3044 0.254 ## 4 abbeybe01 38 225 0.169 ## 5 abbeych01 493 1756 0.281 ## 6 abbotfr01 107 513 0.209 #histogram p1 &lt;- ggplot(bats, aes(x = avg)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), color = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;lightseagreen&quot;, alpha = 0.2, binwidth = .005) + geom_density(colour = &#39;black&#39;, lwd=1) + theme_classic() + xlab(&quot;Career Batting Average&quot;) p1 As you can see, this distribution is very negatively (left) skewed. This means that there are many players who have career batting averages between 0.2 and 0.3. There are relatively few players with career averages over 0.3. There are more averages that are less than 0.2 causing the skew. We can directly measure the skewness using the skewness() function from the moments package. We can see that it is highly negatively skewed with a value of -1.01: library(moments) ## Warning: package &#39;moments&#39; was built under R version 3.5.2 skewness(bats$avg) ## [1] -1.012683 Let's look at where the median, mean and mode are for this negatively skewed distribution. median(bats$avg) ## [1] 0.2466792 mean(bats$avg) ## [1] 0.237972 estimate_mode(bats$avg) ## [1] 0.2538827 This time, these descriptive values are not equal. The median and mean are lower than the mode. In fact, the mean is lowest of all. In negative skewed distributions, the mean and median get pulled towards the skewed tail of the distribution, but the mean gets pulled further. p1 + geom_vline(xintercept = median(bats$avg), color = &quot;blue&quot;, lwd=1)+ geom_vline(xintercept = mean(bats$avg), color = &quot;red&quot;, lwd=1)+ geom_vline(xintercept = estimate_mode(bats$avg), color = &quot;darkorange&quot;, lwd=1) Now let's look at what happens to the mode, median and mean in right skewed distributions. Let's look at the career at-bats of MLB players. #histogram p2 &lt;- ggplot(bats, aes(x = totalAB)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), color = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;plum&quot;, alpha = 0.2, binwidth = 200) + geom_density(colour = &#39;black&#39;, lwd=1) + theme_classic() p2 This distribution is extremely right (positive) skewed. If we measure the skewness we find that the skewness is 1.63. skewness(bats$totalAB) ## [1] 1.626115 Now, let's look at the median, mean and mode and plot these on the distribution: median(bats$totalAB) ## [1] 1037 mean(bats$totalAB) ## [1] 1958.68 estimate_mode(bats$totalAB) ## [1] 454.0069 p2 + geom_vline(xintercept = median(bats$totalAB), color = &quot;blue&quot;, lwd=1)+ geom_vline(xintercept = mean(bats$totalAB), color = &quot;red&quot;, lwd=1)+ geom_vline(xintercept = estimate_mode(bats$totalAB), color = &quot;darkorange&quot;, lwd=1) In these severely right skewed distribution, we again see that the median and mean get pulled towards the tail of the distribution, with the mean getting pulled even further than the median. Let's have a look at a quick summary figure of where the mean, median and mode lie with respect to each other in skewed distributions. As you can see, the mean always gets pulled the furthest to the tail of distributions.The reason for this is that the mean is much more affected by extreme outliers than the median. The median is simply the boundary which divides the top 50% of the data from the bottom 50% of the data. The mean has to include all values in its calculation, so can be largely affected by extreme values more so than the median. Skewness 7.1.5.2 Kurtosis blah blah blah need to think what to put into this section probably an image of different kurtoses of different distributions. don't need much more than that. kurtosis(bats$totalAB) # &gt;3 = &#39;peaky&#39; less in shoulders of tails ## [1] 5.325537 kurtosis(bats$avg) # &gt;3 = &#39;peaky&#39; less in shoulders of tails ## [1] 4.18612 # kurtosis close to 3 # Note with a smaller sample size, our distribution will # not be as normal, i.e. more skewed and not mesokurtic x1 &lt;- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 100, sd = 5.0) x1 ## [1] 101.45280 95.88441 94.74933 103.10539 99.47551 99.23445 98.87608 ## [8] 102.12954 100.12076 99.62868 mean(x1) ## [1] 99.46569 sd(x1) ## [1] 2.586687 skewness(x1) ## [1] -0.5130139 kurtosis(x1) ## [1] 2.484758 7.2 z-scores z-scores are a useful way of comparing different scores in different distributions. As an example, let's look at the two distributions below. On the left we have the population of all Airedale Terriers that is normally distributed with a mean of 60 lbs with a standard deviation of 6 lbs. On the right we have the population of all Scottish Terriers that is normally distributed with a mean of 20 lbs and a standard deviation of 0.4 lbs. terriers If you owned an Airedale Terrier that was 65 lbs and a Scottish Terrier that was 20.5 lbs, would you be able to say which one was relatively larger than their breed average? Both of them are above the mean of their breeds, but by how much? The Airedale Terrier is (65-60) 5 lbs heavier than the mean of the breed, whereas the Scottish Terrier is only (20.5-20) 0.5 lbs heavier than its breed average. Looking at things in absolute terms however is misleading. It would be better if we could somehow standardize these differences. This is where z-scores come in. z-scores enable us to calcualte how far any datapoint is from the mean of its distribution by saying how many &quot;standard deviations&quot; away from the mean it is. Let's look at the Airedale Terrier. Your Airedale is 5 lbs heavier than the mean of 60 lbs. This is a bit less than one standard deviation above the mean, as the standard deviation is 6 lbs. However, your Scottish Terrier is 0.5 lbs heavier than the mean of 20 lbs, which is a bit more than the standard deviation of 0.4 lbs for that breed. We can calculate precisely how many standard deviations away from the mean they are using z-scores. This is the formula: \\(z=\\frac{x - {\\mu}_x}{\\sigma_x}\\) Using this formula, let's calculate the z-scores for each of our dogs: #Airedale (65 - 60) / 6 ## [1] 0.8333333 #Scottish (20.5 - 20) / 0.4 ## [1] 1.25 The z-score for our 65 lb Airedale is z=0.83. The z-score for our 20.5 lb Scottish is z=1.25. This shows us that our Scottish Terrier is actual more standard deviations away from its breed mean than is our Airedale Terrier dog. We could also plot each of these z-scores on top of the standard normal distribution. Remember, this is the specific case of the normal distribution where the mean of the distribution is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. Shown below, we've plotted on the top row the breed population histograms with red vertical lines the weights of each of these dogs on their respective population histogram. On the bottom row we have these values converted to their z-scores and still shown with a red line. Each is overlaid on top of a standard normal distribution. z-scores z-scores can be very useful ways of standardizing observed values into ways that we can directly compare across different distributions. If we calculate a negative z-score then it's clear that our observed value is below the population mean, and if we calculate a positive z-score then our value is greater than the population mean. The size of the z-score relates to how many population standard deviations from the mean each value is overall. 7.2.1 z-scores in samples. Often we may not know the population mean or standard deviation. In such cases if all we have is a sample mean and a sample standard deviation, we can still calcualte z-scores for such samples. We effectively use the same formula to calculate the z-scores, just subsituting in the sample mean and standard deviation. \\(z=\\frac{x - {\\mu}_x}{\\sigma_x}\\) For instance, let's look at the following sample of ages for players on a village cricket team: ages &lt;- c(23, 19, 21, 33, 51, 40, 16, 15, 61, 55, 30, 28) mean(ages) ## [1] 32.66667 sd(ages) ## [1] 15.74417 These data clearly don't look normally distributed, but we still are able to calculate a mean and standard deviation. We can also still calculate the z-scores for each age: z &lt;- (ages - mean(ages)) / sd(ages) z ## [1] -0.61398401 -0.86804636 -0.74101519 0.02117186 1.16445243 0.46578097 ## [7] -1.05859312 -1.12210871 1.79960831 1.41851478 -0.16937490 -0.29640607 You'll notice that those individuals that have negative z-scores are younger than the mean age of 32.67. Those individuals with positive z-scores are older than the mean age of 32.67. The largest z-score in terms of magnitude (either in the positive or negative direction) is 1.8. This person was 61 and was 1.8 standard deviations older than the average age. Although it's possible to calculate z-scores for any sample, if the sample data come from a normally distributed population then we can use this z-score principle to perform inferential statistics (see xxx.xxx) 7.2.2 Using z-scores to determine probabilities One of the great things about the normal distribution, is that we can calculate quite straightforwardly what proportion of the distribution lies under the curve for any distance away from the mean measured in standard deviation. With computers, this is a very trivial task to perform, as we'll see shortly. Prior to the computer age, these computations weren't as easy, so we'd often use something called the empirical rule. This is basically a framework that tell us what proportion of the distribution lies under the curve at 1\\(\\sigma\\), 2\\(\\sigma\\), 3\\(\\sigma\\), etc. from the mean. Let's look at the distribution below, which is normally distributed with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 14 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 4. The first thing to note is that a normal distribution is perfectly symmetrical, with equal area under the curve on either side of the mean. Therefore, in our example, 50% of the distribution lies below the mean of 14, and 50% of datapoints lie above the mean. The area colored in green in the distribution represents the area of the distribution that lies \\(\\mu \\pm1\\sigma\\). The area colored in pinky-purple lie between \\(\\mu+1\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu+2\\sigma\\) or between \\(\\mu-1\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu-2\\sigma\\). The area colored in yellow lie between \\(\\mu+2\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu+3\\sigma\\) or between \\(\\mu-2\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu-3\\sigma\\). The blue areas represent the proportion of the distribution that lies beyond \\(\\mu \\pm4\\sigma\\). Rather than look at the proportion that lies between two boundaries, often instead we describe the proportion of the distribution that lies to the left of a certain value. The table below shows what proportion of the distribution lie to the left of each value. For instance, in the above distribution \\(\\mu+2\\sigma=22\\). According to the table below, we have 97.72% of the data/distribution that are to the left of \\(x=22\\). The above table and histogram are obviously useful guides for knowing what proportion of the data exist at certain breakpoints. But, what if you had a value of \\(x=17.5\\) in the above distribution? What proportion of the data are below this value? Well we can actually work this out if we convert our raw scores to z-scores. Once we have a z-score, we can calculate the area to the left of any point on the standard normal curve. Our value of \\(x=17.5\\) has a z-score of 0.875, so it is 0.875 standard deviations above the mean. (17.5 - 14) /4 ## [1] 0.875 Let's look at that on the standard normal curve, with the value \\(z = 0.875\\) represented by the red solid line. We can obtain the area in the distribution to the left of this value that is shaded in light red in R, using the function pnorm(). pnorm(0.875) ## [1] 0.809213 This shows us that 80.92% of the distribution lie to the left of \\(z=0.875\\). To get what proportion of the distribution lie to the right of this value, we just subtract it from 1. 1 - pnorm(0.875) ## [1] 0.190787 Let's look at the proportions under the curve to the left of plus or minus 0, 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations from the mean. zvals &lt;- c(-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3) pnorm(zvals) ## [1] 0.001349898 0.022750132 0.158655254 0.500000000 0.841344746 0.977249868 ## [7] 0.998650102 Hopefully you can see that these values mirror those in the table provided above. 7.2.2.1 z-score and probability problems. Let's take this a little further with some small examples. Example 1 Let's assume that the weights of pineapples are normally distributed with a mean of 1003.5g and a standard deviation of 35g. You bought a random pineapple and it turned out to only be 940g. What proportion of pineapples are less than 940g? How unlucky did you get to buy such a small pineapple? First, let's take a look at the population distribution of pineapples with \\(\\mu=1003.5\\) and \\(\\sigma=35\\). Our pineapple is 940g and is shown with the solid red line below. As our distribution is normal, if we convert this to a z-score we can compare it to where z is in the standard normal distribution on the right. (940 - 1003.5) / 35 ## [1] -1.814286 So we calculated that \\(z = -1.81\\), and we visualize that on our standard normal distribution. We're interested in what proportion of pineapples from the distribution are 940g or less. That is the light red shaded area. To calculate that we can just use pnorm() in R: pnorm(-1.81) ## [1] 0.03514789 From this we can see that only 3.5% of pineapples are less than 940g. We got super unlucky to get such a tiny pineapple. Example 2 What is the probability of getting a pineapple of greater than 1050g ? To answer this we first get the z-score for a pineapple of 1050g, and find that \\(z = 1.33\\). (1050 - 1003.5) / 35 ## [1] 1.328571 Next we recognize that if we're interested in what proportion of pineapples weigh more than 1050g, we need to know what proportion of the standard normal curve is greater than \\(z = 1.33\\) (the shaded light red area below). We can calculate that by using pnorm() to figure out what proportion is to the left of \\(z = 1.33\\), and then subtract that from 1 to get what proportion is to the right. 1 - pnorm(1.33) #0.003 (so 9.18% chance) ## [1] 0.09175914 Example 3 What is the probability of getting a pineapple between 950g and 1045g ? For this question, we're interested in the shaded light red area between \\(z = x\\) and \\(z = z\\) on the standard normal curve. Why these z-values? Because these are the z scores you get if you convert a 950g and a 1045g pineapple to z scores. z1 &lt;- (950 - 1003.5) / 35 z2 &lt;- (1045 - 1003.5) / 35 z1 #-1.53 ## [1] -1.528571 z2 #1.19 ## [1] 1.185714 In R we can calculate the proportion to the left of each of these z-scores using pnorm(). What we need is the shaded area, which we can get if we subtract the area to the left of \\(z = -1.53\\) from the area to the left of \\(z = 1.19\\). We do it like this: ## get proportion of curve to left of each z-score pnorm(z1) # 0.06 ## [1] 0.06318536 pnorm(z2) # 0.88 ## [1] 0.8821324 # so the area between them is: pnorm(z2) - pnorm(z1) #0.82 ## [1] 0.8189471 So, 82% of the distribution lie between 950g and 1040g. 7.3 What is a Sampling Distribution ? Another type of distribution that we will discuss a lot! is the sampling distribution. There are different types of sampling distributions, so for now we'll focus on the sampling distribution of the sample means. The best way to illustrate a sampling distribution, is to show it by example. Say we have a population of 1 million adult Archerfish. The population mean \\(\\mu\\) is 100.0mm, and the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is equal to 15.0mm. Let's create this population: set.seed(3) archerfish &lt;- rnorm(n = 1000000, mean = 100, sd = 15) mean(archerfish) ## [1] 100.0061 sd(archerfish) ## [1] 15.02418 Let's also plot what this normally distrubted population looks like by making a histogram: # histogram of the population: ggplot(data.frame(archerfish), aes(x = archerfish)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;black&#39;, fill=&#39;#f584ed&#39;, alpha=.5, binwidth =2) + theme_classic() + xlab(&quot;Body Length mm&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Body Sizes of 1 million Archerfish&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = 100.0, lwd=1, color=&#39;black&#39;) OK, let's say that you didn't have the time to go out and catch 1 million Archerfish and measure the body length of every single fish. What shoudld you do? One thing you might decide is to just go and take a random sample of 10 anglerfish (you could have picked another sample size - let's just stick with 10 for now). Once you have your sample of 10 archerfish, you could then measure them and you will be able to calculate the sample mean of that sample. We'll use sample() to randomly select 10 archerfish. set.seed(1) # so we all get the same sample. samp1 &lt;- sample(archerfish, 10, replace = T) samp1 ## [1] 83.93889 103.18896 77.19206 104.34995 98.54528 111.00236 85.95220 ## [8] 94.26505 99.79486 97.50949 mean(samp1) ## [1] 95.57391 Our sample mean is 95.6 - that's fairly close to the actual population mean of 100.0mm. Let's grab another three samples of 10 archerfish and see what the sample means are of those sample: mean(sample(archerfish, 10, replace = T)) # mean of our 2nd sample ## [1] 98.35256 mean(sample(archerfish, 10, replace = T)) # mean of our 3rd sample ## [1] 100.4263 mean(sample(archerfish, 10, replace = T)) # mean of our 4th sample ## [1] 99.98449 These next three samples are closer to 100.0, with some being a little bit less than the population mean, and the other being a bit more. What would happen if we collected thousands and thousands of samples of size 10? Let's do it - you don't need to follow the exact code here of how we're doing this, but essentially we're grabbing 10,000 samples of size 10. From each of these we're getting the sample mean. That means we'll end up with 10,000 sample means. We're storing those results in the object called res. ### What if we were to collect 10,000 samples and for each one get the mean results&lt;-vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ results[[i]] &lt;- mean(sample(archerfish, 10, replace = T)) } res &lt;- unlist(results) Now we have our 10,000 sample means we could make a histogram of these sample means. psd &lt;- ggplot(data.frame(res), aes(x = res)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;black&#39;, fill=&#39;#4adbe0&#39;, alpha=.5, binwidth = 1) + theme_classic() + xlab(&quot;Mean Body Length of each sample - mm&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Sampling Distribution of Sample Means for n=10&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(res), lwd=1) psd This distribution that we've just plotted is the sampling distribution of sample means for samples of size n=10. We picked 10,000 as the number of samples of size 10 to collect as it's reasonably large enough to get enough sample means that we can see the shape of the distribution. We could have picked 100,000 samples to collect, or 1,000,000... in fact the more the better, but 10,000 is enough to get the point across. Out of all of these sample means that we &quot;collected&quot;, what is the average across all of the 10,000 samples? - and what's more, what is the standard deviation of that distribution? mean(res) ## [1] 100.0255 sd(res) #standard deviation of the sampling distribution, aka standard error ## [1] 4.742526 Let's first focus on the mean. Our mean of sample means was 100.0, which is the same as the mean of 1,000,000 archerfish in the population! It turns out that the mean of the sampling distribution is approximately equal to the population mean. By the way, the notation that we use to depcit the mean of the sampling distribution of sample means is \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}}\\). So \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}} = 100.0\\). What is the standard deviation of this distribution (the sampling distribution of the sample means)? We just calculated it in R to be 4.74. The notation we use for this is \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = 4.74\\). It's called the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample means, but for short it gets called the standard error. Of course, we never in reality actually collect thousands and thousands of samples - that defeats the point of sampling. If we had time to collect thousands and thousands of samples, we may as well just measure every archerfish in the population. Usually, we just collect one sample. In later sections, we'll discuss how you can estimate what \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}\\) are when you have only collected one sample. However, given we already know the population standard deviation of the 1 million archerfish is \\(\\sigma=15\\), we can calculate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample means for any sample size. It is calculated using the formula: \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) So in our case it should be equal to: 15/sqrt(10) # 4.74 ## [1] 4.743416 As you can see this is the same value that we got in our simulated sampling distribution above. 7.3.1 Sample Size and the Sampling Distribution In the previous section we looked at what would happen if we took samples of size 10 from our archerfish population and looked at the sample means of each sample. We found that when we made a histogram out of these sample means, that the mean of the sample means \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}}\\) was approximately equal to the population mean of 100. The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of sample means, or standard error, \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}\\) was equal to 4.74. What happens if we were to take a different sized sample each time - say size 50? What would be the mean and standard deviation of this distribution of sample means? Let's find out. We'll again take 1000 samples of size 50 at random from our population of 1 million archerfish. For each sample we'll record the sample mean length of the 50 fish. We'll end up saving these 10,000 sample means in an R object called res1. Again, don't worry about how the code is doing it here, just as long as you follow what we're doing. # ok, get 10,000 samples of size 50 results1&lt;-vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ results1[[i]] &lt;- mean(sample(archerfish, 50, replace = T)) } res1 &lt;- unlist(results1) Now we have our 10,000 samples, let's plot the histogram psd2 &lt;- ggplot(data.frame(res1), aes(x = res1)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;black&#39;, fill=&#39;#4adbe0&#39;, alpha=.5, binwidth = .5) + theme_classic() + xlab(&quot;Mean Body Length of each sample - mm&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Sampling Distribution of Sample Means for n=50&quot;)+ geom_vline(xintercept = mean(res1),lwd=1) psd2 If we look at the mean and standard deviation of this sampling distribution, we get the following values: mean(res1) # still same as population mean ## [1] 100.0114 sd(res1) # smaller with larger sample size ## [1] 2.116454 The mean of the sampling distribution of sample means \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}}\\) is still a very good estimate of the population mean - in fact, it's a tiny, tiny bit better than when we had samples of size 10. The biggest difference is in the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}\\) (the standard error), which is much lower than when we had samples of size 10. The reason for this is that the variability in our sample means is much more reduced when we have samples of size 50. On average, our sample means are much closer individual estimates to the population mean. This is what drastically reduces the standard deviation of this sampling distribution. We could have calculated the standard error directly using the formula provided earlier, because we already know the population standard deviation. When we use that formala we get 2.12, essentially the same standard deviation as we got with our simulated sampling distribution: 15 / sqrt(50) ## [1] 2.12132 Let's directly compare the two sampling distributions for the two different sample sizes. We adjusted the x-axis so it is the same for both figures, so you can see the change in the standard deviation between the two sample sizes: 7.4 Central Limit Theorem. In the previous section we discovered that if you take many, many samples from a normally distributed population and calculated the sample mean of each sample, that you would get a sampling distribution of sample means. We also saw that that sampling distribution was normally distributed with a mean \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}}\\) that was approximately equal to the population mean, and a standard deviation \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}\\) that was equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of n \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). Is it just coincidence that both the population distribution and the sampling distribution was approximately normally distributed? What we will learn in this chapter is that it does not matter at all what the population distribution is - if we take thousands of samples from any shaped distribution and calculate the sample mean of each sample, when we create the histogram of those sample means we will find that they are approximately normally distributed. This is what we refer to as the central limit theorem. Further, the larger the sample size that we take, the closer to a normal distribution the sampling distribution becomes. Let's look at this by taking samples from various different population distributions. Uniform Distribution First we'll look at a uniform distribution of 1 million numbers between 0 and 75. You might like to think of this as the distance of trees from the center of a forest in km. Let's graph the distribution and calculate the mean and standard deviation. set.seed(1) #get data from uniform distribution x1 &lt;- runif(1000000, min = 0, max = 75) # histogram ggplot(data.frame(x1), aes(x = x1)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;black&#39;, fill = &quot;#894ae0&quot;, alpha=.3, binwidth = 5, boundary = 0) + theme_classic() + xlab(&quot;Distance from Center of Forest km&quot;) ### Population Mean &amp; SD mean(x1) #37.5 ## [1] 37.49417 sd(x1) #21.6 ## [1] 21.6472 We can see that the mean of this population is 37.5, and the population standard deviation is 37.5. Let's take samples of size 30 at random from this population of 1 million. For each sample, we'll calculate the sample mean. We'll take 10,000 samples (again - we could have picked any really large number here, but 10,000 seems reasonable enough to prove our point). After we get our 10,000 sample means from samples of size 30, we'll plot the histogram of those sample means. ## Let&#39;s get 10,000 samples of size 30 results&lt;-vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ results[[i]] &lt;- mean(sample(x1, 30, replace = T)) } res &lt;- unlist(results) # This is the sampling distribution. ggplot(data.frame(res), aes(x = res)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;black&#39;, fill=&#39;#894ae0&#39;, alpha=.5, binwidth = 1) + theme_classic() + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(res), lwd=1) + xlab(&quot;Mean of each sample&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Sampling Distribution of Sample Means for n=30&quot;) This histogram represents our sampling distribution of sample means when we took samples of size 30 from a uniform distribution. Hopefully you notice that it is approximately normally distributed - even though the original population was uniformally distributed! Let's calculate the mean and standard deviation of this sampling distribution: mean(res) # the mean of the sample means is close to 37.5, the population mean ## [1] 37.49964 sd(res) #3.9 - this is a lot smaller than the population SD ## [1] 3.995888 The mean of our sampling distribution \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}} = 37.5\\) which is again approximately equal to the population mean. The sampling distribution standard deviation \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = 3.94\\) which is a lot lower than the original population standard deviation. Because we only took 10,000 samples, these values aren't exact, but we could have calculated the standard error by taking the population standard deviation and dividing by the square root of n \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) as follows: sd(x1)/sqrt(30) # standard error. ## [1] 3.952219 Skewed Distributions We can see that the central limit theorem holds true for skewed distributions also. Here, we have a population of 1 million charity donations. Let's draw a hisogram of the population distribution and calculate the mean and standard deviation of the population. set.seed(1) # e.g. Donations to a charity (in $s) q &lt;- rnbinom(1000000, 5, .4) # histogram ggplot(data.frame(q), aes(x = q)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;black&#39;, fill = &quot;#1ad665&quot;, alpha=.3, binwidth = 1, boundary = 0) + theme_classic() + xlab(&quot;Charity Donation in $&quot;) ### Population Mean mean(q) #7.5 ## [1] 7.504368 sd(q) #4.33 ## [1] 4.331767 It is clear that this population distribution is highly positively skewed. The mean of the population is 7.5 and the standard deviation is 4.33. In the following code we takes samples of size 30 and calculate the sample mean of each sample. This time, we'll collect 50,000 samples, just to be a bit different. results&lt;-vector(&#39;list&#39;,50000) for(i in 1:10000){ results[[i]] &lt;- mean(sample(q, 30, replace = T)) } res &lt;- unlist(results) ### Let&#39;s Draw this as a histogram. ggplot(data.frame(res), aes(x = res)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;black&#39;, fill=&#39;#31e8d0&#39;, alpha=.5, binwidth = .1) + theme_classic() + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(res), lwd=1) + xlab(&quot;Mean of each sample&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Sampling Distribution of Sample Means for n=30&quot;) So, it happened again. This is our sampling distribution of sample means, collected from samples of size 30 from a highly skewed distribution. But once again, the sampling distribution is approximately normally distributed. It might not be perfectly normally distributed, but it is close to being normal. We can calculate the mean and the standard deviation of this sampling distribution: mean(res) # the mean of the sample means is close to 7.5 ## [1] 7.504313 sd(res) #0.79 ## [1] 0.7981555 \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}} = 7.5\\) which is once again approximately equal to the original population mean. The sampling distribution standard deviation \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = 0.79\\). We could have directly calculated that using the formula for the standard error, n \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\), as we know the original population standard deviation: sd(q)/sqrt(30) # standard error = 0.79 ## [1] 0.7908688 We could keep going with even more types of population distributions. We would find the same thing over and over again. If we take many samples from each population and calculated the sample means of all samples, they would form an approximately normally distribution. This will be especially true for larger samples. This is the basis of the central limit theorem. In the following sections we'll learn more about what we can do with these sampling distributions. 7.5 Sampling distribution problems. We can use our knowledge of sampling distributions and z-scores to determine how likely or unlikely we are to observe any one particular sample mean. Let's use an example to illustrate this. Q. Say the weight of chicken eggs is normally distributed with mean 60g and standard deviation of 3g. What is the probability of getting a batch of a dozen eggs that have a mean of less than 58g ? The way to think about these questions is to recognize that we're dealing with a sampling distribution. We're really being asked what proportion of the sampling distribution is less than a sample mean of 58g, when your sample size is 12 (a dozen). First, let's plot the population of chicken eggs and then the sampling distribution of samples means for a sample size of 12. set.seed(1) # so you get the same values as my script ### First, I&#39;ll make some plots of the &#39;population&#39; and &#39;sampling distribution&#39; ## Population x &lt;- rnorm(1000000, mean = 60, sd = 3) p1 &lt;- ggplot(data.frame(x), aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;black&#39;, fill=&#39;mistyrose&#39;, alpha=.4)+ geom_vline(xintercept = 60, lwd=1) + ggtitle(&quot;Population of chicken eggs&quot;) + theme_classic() + xlab(&quot;Weight&quot;) ## Sampling Distribution of sample means with Sample size of 12 (a dozen). results&lt;-vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ results[[i]] &lt;- mean(sample(x, 12, replace = T)) } res &lt;- unlist(results) p2 &lt;- ggplot(data.frame(res), aes(x=res)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&#39;lightseagreen&#39;, alpha=.4)+ geom_vline(xintercept = mean(res),lwd=1) + ggtitle(&quot;Sampling Distribution of Sample Means&quot;) + theme_classic() + xlab(&quot;sample mean&quot;) library(gridExtra) grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1) What are the mean and standard deviation of this sampling distribution of sample means? Well, \\(\\mu_{\\overline{x}} = 60\\) because that's the population mean, and we know the mean of the sample means is approximately the same. We know we can calculate \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}\\) because we know the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). Again, the formula is \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). Therefore, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is \\(\\sigma_{\\overline{x} = 0.87\\): sem &lt;- 3 / sqrt(12) sem ## [1] 0.8660254 Now, we're interested in a sample of 12 that has a sample mean of 58g. Let's visualize what that looks like on the histogram of the sampling distribution: p2 + geom_vline(xintercept = 58, lty=2, lwd=1, color=&quot;red&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Sampling Distribution of Sample Means \\n for sample size = 12&quot;) Because we know the mean and standard deviation of this distribution, we can actually calculate the sample mean of 58g as a z-score. Doing this we find that \\(z = -2.31\\), which means that a sample mean of 58g is 2.31 standard deviations below the mean. # so, 58g as a z-score is... z &lt;- (58 - 60) / sem # -2.31 z ## [1] -2.309401 The original question asked what probability there was of getting a sample mean of less than 58g. This is basically what area is under the curve of the above sampling distribution to the left of the 58g sample mean. Because we converted that sample mean of 58g to a z-score of -2.31, we can look at that value on a standard normal curve. The area we are iterested in is the filled in area to the left of z = -2.31: We can look up this value in R, using the function pnorm. pnorm(z) # prob = 0.010 ## [1] 0.01046067 So we can see that the probability of getting a sample mean of lower than 58g is p=0.0105. 7.6 The t-distribution Another distribution that is important to know about is the t-distribution. Like the normal distribution, this is a symmetrical distribution, but it has slighly fatter tails than the normal distribution. The t-distribution comes up most commonly in sampling distributions. In particular, although the central limit theorem prescribes that sampling distributions are approximately normal, it is known that often they aren't approximately normal enough, and instead they follow a t-distribution shape. An important detail about the t-distribution is that there are actually several t-distributions. There are different t-distributions for different degrees of freedom. These differ slightly in how heavy the tails of the distribution are. The degrees of freedom are usually related to the sample size minus one or two (depending upon the test being employed - see sections xxx.xxx and xxx.xxx). The higher the degrees of freedom, the more closely the t-distribution looks like a normal distribution. You can see this in the image below. The standard normal distribution is in red, and the t-distribution is in black. Each panel shows a different t-distribution. As the degrees of freedom increase, the t-distribution essentially becomes the normal distribution. At lower degrees of freedom, there is a lot more difference between the t-distribution and the normal distribution in the tails. "],

The trendline is to help demonstrate how correlations of different magnitudes look in terms of their association. Correlations 10.2 Calculating the Pearson Correlation in R To calculate the correlation coefficient in R, it's pretty straightforward. You simply can use the cor() function. For instance, let's correlate... cor(1:10,1:10) # replace with an example ## [1] 1 Before we go further into what we should do with these correlations, and how to signficance test them, let's learn a little bit more about how they come about. 10.3 Cross-products The formula for calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient for a sample is: \\(r = \\frac{\\sum_{}^{} z_{x}z_{y}}{n - 1}\\) When we have a population, we can use the formula: \\(r = \\frac{\\sum_{}^{} z_{x}z_{y}}{N}\\) Essentially, the steps are to convert all the X and Y scores into their respective z-scores. Then you mutliply these two values together to get the cross-product. After summing up all the cross-products for each data point, we divide this number by n-1 if we're dealing with a sample (we usually are), or N if we're dealing with a population. The sum of the cross-products will therefore be largely positive if positive z-scores are multiple together or if negative z-scores are multiplied together. The sum of the cross-products will be largely negative if negative z-scores are multipled with positive z-scores. The following example should help make this clearer. Look at the following data, its scatterplot and the correlation coefficient. They show that we have a positive correlation of r=0.84. Let's break it down how we got that value. x &lt;- c(1.1, 1.5, 2.1, 3.5, 3.6, 3.5, 2.6, 5.6, 4.4, 3.9) y &lt;- c(2.8, 2.9, 1.6, 5.5, 4.7, 8.1, 3.3, 7.7, 7.1, 5.8) df &lt;- data.frame(x, y) df ## x y ## 1 1.1 2.8 ## 2 1.5 2.9 ## 3 2.1 1.6 ## 4 3.5 5.5 ## 5 3.6 4.7 ## 6 3.5 8.1 ## 7 2.6 3.3 ## 8 5.6 7.7 ## 9 4.4 7.1 ## 10 3.9 5.8 ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(size=2) cor(x,y) ## [1] 0.8418262 First, let's calculate the means and standard deviation (using sd so a sample standard deviation) of x and y. We need to get these values so we can calculate the z-scores of each. # step 1: Get the mean and sd of x and y mean(x) ## [1] 3.18 sd(x) ## [1] 1.370158 mean(y) ## [1] 4.95 sd(y) ## [1] 2.259916 Now, we can calculate the z-scores, remembering that the formula for that is: \\(z = \\frac{x - \\overline{x}}{s_{x}}\\) # step 2. Calculate z-scores of x, and z-scores of y. df$zx &lt;- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x) # z scores of x df$zy &lt;- (y - mean(y)) / sd(y) # z scores of y df ## x y zx zy ## 1 1.1 2.8 -1.5180729 -0.9513626 ## 2 1.5 2.9 -1.2261358 -0.9071132 ## 3 2.1 1.6 -0.7882302 -1.4823557 ## 4 3.5 5.5 0.2335497 0.2433718 ## 5 3.6 4.7 0.3065340 -0.1106236 ## 6 3.5 8.1 0.2335497 1.3938569 ## 7 2.6 3.3 -0.4233088 -0.7301155 ## 8 5.6 7.7 1.7662195 1.2168592 ## 9 4.4 7.1 0.8904082 0.9513626 ## 10 3.9 5.8 0.5254868 0.3761201 Following this, we simply multiple the z-scores of x and y against each other for every data point: # step 3.

Notice why the majority are positive. This is because we have multiplied positive \\(z_{x}\\) with positive \\(z_{y}\\) or we multiplied negative \\(z_{x}\\) with negative \\(z_{y}\\). This happens because datapoints that tend to be above the mean for x are also above the mean for y, and points that are below the mean of x are also below the mean of y. We can add this up to get the sum of the cross-products. That is the \\(\\sum_{}^{} z_{x}z_{y}\\) in the formula. # step 4. Sum up the cross products. sum(df$zxzy) # 7.58 ## [1] 7.576436 We now divide that by n-1 as we have a sample, to get the correlation coefficient r. That gives us an estimation of the average cross-product. # step 5- calculate &#39;r&#39; by dividing by n-1. (for a sample) sum(df$zxzy) / 9 # our n was 10, so n-1 = 9 ## [1] 0.8418262 sum(df$zxzy) / (nrow(df) - 1) # nrow(df) is more generalizable ## [1] 0.8418262 # r=0.84 Just as a quick second example, here is a work through calculating a negative correlation. Notice the \\(z_{x}\\) and \\(z_{y}\\) scores that are multiplied together. They are largely opposite in terms of signs. This is what leads to a negative sum of cross-products and the negative correlation. Why? Because data points that are above the mean for x are generally below the mean in terms of y and visa-versa. ### Example 2.

Let's use some BlueJay data to do this. We'll just use data on male birds. library(tidyverse) jays &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/BlueJays.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## BirdID = col_character(), ## KnownSex = col_character(), ## BillDepth = col_double(), ## BillWidth = col_double(), ## BillLength = col_double(), ## Head = col_double(), ## Mass = col_double(), ## Skull = col_double(), ## Sex = col_integer() ## ) jayM &lt;- jays %&gt;% filter(KnownSex == &quot;M&quot;) # we&#39;ll just look at Males nrow(jayM) # 63 observations ## [1] 63 head(jayM) ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## BirdID KnownSex BillDepth BillWidth BillLength Head Mass Skull Sex ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0000-00000 M 8.26 9.21 25.9 56.6 73.3 30.7 1 ## 2 1142-05901 M 8.54 8.76 25.0 56.4 75.1 31.4 1 ## 3 1142-05905 M 8.39 8.78 26.1 57.3 70.2 31.2 1 ## 4 1142-05909 M 8.71 9.84 25.5 57.3 74.9 31.8 1 ## 5 1142-05912 M 8.74 9.28 25.4 57.1 75.1 31.8 1 ## 6 1142-05914 M 8.72 9.94 30 60.7 78.1 30.7 1 Let's say you're interested in examining whether there is an association between Body Mass and Head Size. First we'll make a scatterplot between the Mass and Head columns. We'll also investigate the correlation using cor(). ggplot(jayM, aes(x=Mass, y=Head)) + geom_point(shape = 21, colour = &quot;navy&quot;, fill = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;) + stat_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, se=F) cor(jayM$Mass, jayM$Head) # r = 0.58, a strong positive correlation. ## [1] 0.5773562 To run the significance test, we do the following: cor.test(jayM$Head, jayM$Mass) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: jayM$Head and jayM$Mass ## t = 5.5228, df = 61, p-value = 7.282e-07 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.3846090 0.7218601 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5773562 This gives us a lot of information. Firstly, at the bottom it repeats the correlation coefficient cor. At the top, it gives us the value of t which is essentially how surprising it is for us to get the correlation we did assuming we were drawing our sample from a population where there is no correlation. Associated with this t value is the degrees of freedom which is equal to n-2, so in this case that is 63-2 = 61. The p-value is also given. If we are using alpha=0.05 as our significance level, then we can reject the hypothesis that there is no overall correlation in the population between Body Mass and Head size if p&lt;0.05. The default for cor.test() is to do a two-tailed test. This is testing whether your observed correlation r is different from r=0 in either the positive or negative direction. This default version also gives us the confidence interval for the correlation coefficient. Essentially, this gives us the interval in which we have a 95% confidence that the true population r lies (remember we just have data from one sample that theoretically comes from a population). It's also possible however that you had an a priori prediction about the direction of the effect. For instance, you may have predicted that Body Mass would be positively correlated with Head Size. In this case, you could do a one-tailed correlation test, where your alternative hypothesis is that there is a positive correlation and the null is that the correlation coefficient is equal to 0 or less than 0. To do one-tailed tests you need to add the alternative argument. # testing if there is a positive correlation cor.test(jayM$Head, jayM$Mass, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: jayM$Head and jayM$Mass ## t = 5.5228, df = 61, p-value = 3.641e-07 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is greater than 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4187194 1.0000000 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5773562 # testing if there is a negative correlation cor.test(jayM$Head, jayM$Mass, alternative = &quot;less&quot;) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: jayM$Head and jayM$Mass ## t = 5.5228, df = 61, p-value = 1 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is less than 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -1.0000000 0.7017994 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5773562 10.5 Assumptions of Pearson's Correlation The Pearson Correlation Coefficient requires your data to be approximately normally distributed. To do this we have various options how to test for normality. Firstly, we could do a Shapiro-Wilk test, which formally determines whether our data are normal. This is done using shapiro.test(), where we assume our data are from a normal population if the resulting p-value is above 0.05. If the p-value is below 0.05 then we have evidence to reject that our data come from a normal population. With our data above, this would look like this when running the test on each variable: shapiro.test(jayM$Mass) # P &gt; 0.05, therefore cannot reject null that data is not normal ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: jayM$Mass ## W = 0.97222, p-value = 0.1647 shapiro.test(jayM$Head) # P &gt; 0.05, therefore cannot reject null that data is not normal ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: jayM$Head ## W = 0.96521, p-value = 0.07189 We can also make a QQ-plot for each variable. Essentially what we require from this plot is for the majority of our data to fall on the straight line - especially the datapoints in the middle. Some deviation at the tails is ok. This plot orders our data and plots the observed data against values on the x-axis that we would expect to get if our data was truly from a normal population. qqnorm(jayM$Mass) qqline(jayM$Mass, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) qqnorm(jayM$Head) qqline(jayM$Head, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) Both of these QQ plots are ok, and indicate normality, as does our Shapiro-Wilk tests. Therefore we would be ok to use a Pearson Correlation test with these data. What should you do though if either of your continuous variables are not approximately normally distributed? In that case, there are other correlation coefficients and associated significance tests that you could run instead. We describe these in more detail in Section x.xxx 10.6 Confidence Intervals for R bit more on this and the theory. 10.7 Partial Correlations why.... the stupid formula.... and how to do in R.... and that there are technically better ways... 10.8 Non-parametric Correlations examples.... when I can be bothered, edit this code chunk down into words + code When at least on of our variables are not normal, then we need to consider alternative approaches to the Pearson correlation for assessing correlations. Let's take this example, where we are interested in seeing if there's an association between saturated fat and cholesterol levels across a bunch of different cheeses: library(tidyverse) cheese &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/cheese.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## type = col_character(), ## sat_fat = col_double(), ## polysat_fat = col_double(), ## monosat_fat = col_double(), ## protein = col_double(), ## carb = col_double(), ## chol = col_integer(), ## fiber = col_double(), ## kcal = col_integer() ## ) head(cheese) ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## type sat_fat polysat_fat monosat_fat protein carb chol fiber kcal ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 blue 18.7 0.8 7.78 21.4 2.34 75 0 353 ## 2 brick 18.8 0.784 8.60 23.2 2.79 94 0 371 ## 3 brie 17.4 0.826 8.01 20.8 0.45 100 0 334 ## 4 camembert 15.3 0.724 7.02 19.8 0.46 72 0 300 ## 5 caraway 18.6 0.83 8.28 25.2 3.06 93 0 376 ## 6 cheddar 21.1 0.942 9.39 24.9 1.28 105 0 403 # let&#39;s make a scatterplot of saturated fat against cholesterol ggplot(cheese, aes(x = sat_fat, y = chol)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,se=F) It looks like there is a pretty obvious relationship, but let's check the normality of each variable before progressing. Firstly the Shapiro-Wilk tests suggest that our data do not come from a normal distribution: shapiro.test(cheese$sat_fat) # P &lt; 0.05, therefore data may not be normal ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: cheese$sat_fat ## W = 0.85494, p-value = 6.28e-07 shapiro.test(cheese$chol) # P &lt; 0.05, therefore data may not be normal ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: cheese$chol ## W = 0.90099, p-value = 2.985e-05 Secondly, we have quite dramatic deviation from the straight line of our datapoints in our QQ plots. This indicates that our dat are likley skewed. qqnorm(cheese$sat_fat) qqline(cheese$sat_fat, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) qqnorm(cheese$chol) qqline(cheese$chol, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) We could be thorough and check this by plotting histograms of our data: library(gridExtra) p1 &lt;- ggplot(cheese, aes(x=sat_fat)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;lightseagreen&quot;) p2 &lt;- ggplot(cheese, aes(x=chol)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;lightseagreen&quot;) grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Because our data do not appear to be normal, we cannot do a Pearson correlation coefficient. We should instead use a non-parametric correlation method. There are several of these to choose from. We don't plan to go into the details here of how these methods determine their correlation coefficients or conduct significance test. In brief, these methods generally rank order the datapoints along the x and y axes and then determine how ordered these ranks are with respect to each other. Probably the most commonly used non-parametric correlation test is called the Spearman Rank Correlation test. To run this, we can use cor() to get the correlation or cor.test() to run the signficance test in the same way we did the Pearson test. However, the difference here is that we specify method=&quot;spearman&quot; at the end. cor(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;spearman&quot;) ## [1] 0.8677042 cor.test(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;spearman&quot;) ## Warning in cor.test.default(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;spearman&quot;): ## Cannot compute exact p-value with ties ## ## Spearman&#39;s rank correlation rho ## ## data: cheese$sat_fat and cheese$chol ## S = 8575.9, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## rho ## 0.8677042 The correlation coefficient here is 0.87 and is termed rho instead of r. With the significance test, you get a test-statistic S which relates to how well ordered the ranked data are. Also provided is a p-value. As with the Pearson, the default is a 2-tailed test, testing whether the obsvered correlation could have come from a population with a correlation of 0. If the p-value is below 0.05 (using alpha = 0.05 as our criterion), then that is reasonable evidence that there is a significant correlation. You may also notice with Spearman Rank correlations that you are forever getting warnings about computing p-values with ties. Don't worry at all about this - although this is an issue with the test and how it calculates the p-value, it isn't of any real practical concern. If you were interested in conducting a one-tailed correlation test, you could do that in the same way as you did for the Pearson. For instance, if you predicted that cholesterol and saturated fat would have a positive correlation, you could do the following to do a one-tailed test: cor.test(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;spearman&quot;, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) ## Warning in cor.test.default(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;spearman&quot;, : ## Cannot compute exact p-value with ties ## ## Spearman&#39;s rank correlation rho ## ## data: cheese$sat_fat and cheese$chol ## S = 8575.9, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true rho is greater than 0 ## sample estimates: ## rho ## 0.8677042 You may also notice that the output of the Spearman Rank test does not give confidence intervals for the value of rho. This is unfortunate and is one of the drawbacks of doing a non-parametric correlation. Finally, there are several other types of non-parametric correlations you could choose from if you didn't want to do a Spearman Rank correlation. We personally recommend using a method called Kendalls Tau B correlation, which can be done like this: cor.test(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;kendall&quot;) ## ## Kendall&#39;s rank correlation tau ## ## data: cheese$sat_fat and cheese$chol ## z = 8.8085, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true tau is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## tau ## 0.7102531 This output gives you a tau value which is the correlation coefficient, and a p-value which you can interpret in the same way as the other tests. Ranked Data If at least one of your variables of your data are rank (ordinal) data, then you should use non-parametric correlations. In the following example, the data show the dominance rank, age, body size and testosterone levels for a group of 18 animals. Lower numbers of the ranks, indicate a higher ranking animal. An animal with rank 1 means that it is the most dominant individual. Perhaps with such data you may be interested in seeing if there was an association between dominance rank and testosterone levels. Because your dominance rank measure is ordinal (a rank), then you should pick a non-parametric correlation. test &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/testosterone.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## drank = col_integer(), ## age = col_double(), ## size = col_integer(), ## testosterone = col_double() ## ) head(test) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## drank age size testosterone ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3 13 183 4.8 ## 2 7 9 155 3.9 ## 3 7 5.5 144 3.8 ## 4 1 11.5 201 6.4 ## 5 12 3.5 125 1.8 ## 6 4 10 166 4.3 ggplot(test, aes(x = drank, y = testosterone)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se=F) + xlab(&quot;Dominance Rank&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Testosterone Level&quot;) cor(test$drank, test$testosterone, method = &quot;spearman&quot;) # rho = -0.91 ## [1] -0.9083378 If you had the a priori prediction, that more dominant animals would have higher testosterone, then you could do a one-tailed test. This would mean that you expect there to be a negative correlation - as the rank number gets higher, the levels of testosterone would fall. In this case, you'd use alternative = &quot;less&quot;. cor.test(test$drank, test$testosterone, method = &quot;spearman&quot;, alternative = &quot;less&quot;) # 1- tailed ## Warning in cor.test.default(test$drank, test$testosterone, method = ## &quot;spearman&quot;, : Cannot compute exact p-value with ties ## ## Spearman&#39;s rank correlation rho ## ## data: test$drank and test$testosterone ## S = 1849.2, p-value = 9.367e-08 ## alternative hypothesis: true rho is less than 0 ## sample estimates: ## rho ## -0.9083378 10.9 Point-Biserial Correlation why, what....

Hopefully the reason why it's called &quot;least squares&quot; will be come obvious, although we're not too sure why it's called &quot;ordinary&quot;. Let's illustrate the question at hand with some data: library(tidyverse) # Import Data df &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/parenthood.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## dan.sleep = col_double(), ## baby.sleep = col_double(), ## dan.grump = col_integer(), ## day = col_integer() ## ) nrow(df) ## [1] 100 head(df) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## dan.sleep baby.sleep dan.grump day ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 7.59 10.2 56 1 ## 2 7.91 11.7 60 2 ## 3 5.14 7.92 82 3 ## 4 7.71 9.61 55 4 ## 5 6.68 9.75 67 5 ## 6 5.99 5.04 72 6 As you can see, what we have are four columns of data. The first column shows the amount of sleep that Dan got in an evening. The second column relates to the amount of sleep a baby got. The third column is a rating of Dan's grumpiness. The last column is a day identifier. Each row represents a different day. Say we're interested in seeing whether there was an association between Dan's sleep and her grumpiness. We could examine this using a scatterplot: # Scatterplot ggplot(df, aes(x = dan.sleep, y = dan.grump)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;, se=F) It looks like these variables are clearly associated, with higher levels of sleep being related to lower levels of grumpiness. To get a measure of how big this relationship is, we could run a correlation test. cor.test(df$dan.sleep, df$dan.grump) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: df$dan.sleep and df$dan.grump ## t = -20.854, df = 98, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.9340614 -0.8594714 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## -0.903384 This shows that the variables are highly correlated with r=-0.90. It's also a highly significant relationship. Using stat_smooth() we also applied a best fitting trendline through the data. This line was actually calculated to be in the position that it is in using regression. The line also has the equation: $y&#39; = a + xb$ You may also se this written in other ways such as: $y&#39; = \\beta_{0} + x\\beta_{1}$ but we'll stick with $y&#39; = a + xb$ 11.2 a and b In the equation for a regression line, $y&#39; = a + xb$ \\(y&#39;\\) is equal to the predicted value of \\(y\\). Essentially if you go from any value of \\(x\\) and go up to the trendline, and then across to the y-axis, that is your predicted value of y. The trendline represents the predicted values of \\(y\\) for all values of \\(x\\). In regression terms, we often refer to \\(x\\) as the predictor variable and \\(y\\) as the outcome variable. The value of \\(b\\) in the equation represents the slope of the regression line. If it's a positive number then it means that the regression line is going upwards (akin to a positive correlation, where \\(y\\) increases as \\(x\\) increases.) If it's a negative number, then it means that the regression line is going downwards (akin to a negative correlation, where \\(y\\) decreases as \\(x\\) increases). The value of \\(b\\) can also be considered to be how much \\(y\\) changes for every 1 unit increase in \\(x\\). So a value of \\(b = -1.4\\) would indicate that as \\(x\\) increases by 1, \\(y\\) will decrease by 1.4. The value of \\(a\\) represents the y-intercept. This is the value of y' that you would get if you extended the regression line to cross at \\(x=0\\). We can illustrate that in the graph below. We extended the trendline (dotted black line) from its ends until it passes through where \\(x=0\\) (the dotted red line). Where it crosses this point is at \\(y=125.96\\) which is depicted by the orange dotted line. This makes the y-intercept for this trendline equal to 125.96. # Scatterplot ggplot(df, aes(x = dan.sleep, y = dan.grump)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;, se=F) + xlim(-1,10)+ ylim(40,130)+ geom_abline(intercept =125.956 , slope = -8.937, lty=2)+ geom_vline(xintercept=0, color=&#39;red&#39;, lty=2) + geom_segment(x=-1.6,xend=0,y=125.96,yend=125.96, lty=2, color=&#39;orange&#39;) In reality, we do not ever extend the reression lines like this. In fact, a regression line by definition only fits the range of datapoints along the x-axis that we have - it should not extend beyond those points. This is more a theoretical construct to help us understand where the line is on the graph. To think a bit more about a and b let's compare these regression lines and their respective equations. comparing a and b In the top left image, you can see three parallel regression lines. These all have the same slope value (b = 0.704). How they differ is in their y-intercept. The different values of 'a' indicate that they are at different heights. In the top right, we've extended the regression lines in red back to where the x-axis is 0. Where the lines cross here (x=0) is the value of each y-intercept i.e. 'a'. In the bottom right image, you can see that all the plots have the same y-intercept value (8.32). How they differ is in their slope b. Two are positive values of b, with the larger value having a steeper slope. The negative value of b (-0.622) has a slope going downwards. In the bottom right we extend these trendlines back to where x=0, and you can see that all have the same y-intercept. 11.2.1 How to calculate a and b in R To run a regression in R, we use the lm() function. It looks like the following: mod1 &lt;- lm(dan.grump ~ dan.sleep, data=df) # build regression model The first thing after the bracket is the outcome variable which is dan.grump. Then a tilde (~) and then the predictor variable which is dan.sleep. Finally, we tell lm what dataset we're using. The best way to read that statement is: &quot;dan.grump 'is predicted by' dan.sleep&quot;. We're also saving the regression model as mod1 because there's tons of information that comes along with the regression. To have a look at what a and b are, we can just look at our saved object mod1. mod1 ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = dan.grump ~ dan.sleep, data = df) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) dan.sleep ## 125.956 -8.937 Here the value underneath &quot;Intercept&quot; (125.956) refers to the y-intercept a. The value underneath dan.sleep, the predictor variable, is our value of b the slope. So this would mean that the regression line for these data would be: \\(y&#39; = 125.956 + -8.937b\\) We can also get these values directly by running the following code: mod1$coefficients ## (Intercept) dan.sleep ## 125.956292 -8.936756 Now, we should also mention one other thing about these values. These regression coefficients are 'estimates'. We have one sample of 100 subjects from which we estimated the true population values of 'a' and 'b'. The true population values of 'a' and 'b' are parameters. 11.2.2 How to calculate a and b 'by hand' To think a bit more about these 'a' and 'b' values, we could look at how these values are actually calculated. First, we calculate 'b'. The formula for this requires knowing the sample standard deviation of the X and Y variables, as well as their Pearson correlation. \\(b = r\\frac{s_{Y}}{s_{X}}\\) So for our example, we'd calculate 'b' like this: r &lt;- cor(df$dan.sleep, df$dan.grump) sy &lt;- sd(df$dan.grump) sx &lt;- sd(df$dan.sleep) b &lt;- r * (sy/sx) b ## [1] -8.936756 Next, we can calculate 'a' using the formula: \\(a = \\overline{Y} - b\\overline{X}\\) . This requires us to know the sample mean of X and Y. So for our example, we calculate 'a' like this: my &lt;- mean(df$dan.grump) mx &lt;- mean(df$dan.sleep) a &lt;- my - (b * mx) a ## [1] 125.9563 Therefore, we have an equation for our trendline which is y' = 125.96 + -8.94b, which means that for every 1 unit increase of sleep, Dan's grumpiness decreases by 8.94. 11.3 Residuals Once we fit a trendline to the data it's clear that not all the datapoints fit to the line. In fact, almost none of the datapoints are on the line! This is because the trendline is our prediction of the value of y based on the value of x. Eeach datapoint actually is either larger or smaller in terms of y than the regression line. Sometimes it's a bit bigger or smaller, other times it might be a lot bigger or smaller. Occasionally, the predicted value of y might be on the regression line. Because our trendline isn't a perfect fit for the data, the formula for the regression line could technically be written as: \\(y&#39; = a + bx + \\epsilon\\) \\(\\epsilon\\) refers to the error, or how far each datapoint is from the predicted value. In fact, the difference of each data point from the predicted value is called a raw residual or ordinary residual. We calculate the size of the residual for each datapoint by the following formula: \\(residual = y - y&#39;\\) This essentially is the difference of each data point from the predicted value. 11.3.1 How to calculate the residuals Using our regression line equation of y' = 125.96 + -8.94b, we can manually calculate the raw residuals. Firstly, we calculate the predicted values of y \\(y&#39;\\) for each value of \\(x\\). We can put these back into our original dataframe.

The following plot is our same scatterplot, but this time we've also added a little red line connecting each observed datapoint to the regression line. The size of each of these red lines represents the residuals. p1 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = dan.sleep, y = dan.grump)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + geom_segment(aes(xend = dan.sleep, yend = dan.grump-residuals), alpha = .5, color=&#39;red&#39;) + theme_classic() + ggtitle(&quot;OLSR best fit trendline&quot;) p1 11.3.3 Comparing our trendline to other trendlines An important question to consider is why did we end up with our trendline and not some other trendline? The answer is that ours is the 'best fit', but what does that really mean? In short, it means that the best-fit regression line is the one that has the smallest squared residuals. The squared residuals are calcualted by squaring every residual and then summing these all up. Let's look at this by looking at one possible trendline that we could have used. The one that we'll choose is a trendline that goes horizonatally through the data with a y value that is the mean of Y. mean(df$dan.grump) ## [1] 63.71 So, the mean of the Y variable dan.grump is 63.71. Let's put a trendline through our data that is horizontal at 63.71. The equation for this line would be: \\(y&#39; = 63.71 + 0x\\) Let's visualize this: ggplot(df, aes(x = dan.sleep, y = dan.grump)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = mean(df$dan.grump), color=&#39;blue&#39;) It doesn't look like using the mean value of Y is that good a predictor of each datapoint. We could actually visualize how good.bad it is by calculating the residual of each datapoint from this new trendline. This time each residual is equal to: \\(residual = y - \\overline{y}\\) Let's calculate these residuals, and then graph them on this scatterplot: # we can work out what the &#39;residuals&#39; would be for this trendline: df$Ymean &lt;- mean(df$dan.grump) df$resid_Ymean &lt;- df$dan.grump - df$Ymean #residual from Ymean head(df) ## # A tibble: 6 x 8 ## dan.sleep baby.sleep dan.grump day Y.pred residuals Ymean resid_Ymean ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7.59 10.2 56 1 58.1 -2.11 63.7 -7.71 ## 2 7.91 11.7 60 2 55.2 4.76 63.7 -3.71 ## 3 5.14 7.92 82 3 80.0 1.99 63.7 18.3 ## 4 7.71 9.61 55 4 57.0 -2.03 63.7 -8.71 ## 5 6.68 9.75 67 5 66.2 0.759 63.7 3.29 ## 6 5.99 5.04 72 6 72.4 -0.409 63.7 8.29 ## visualize this: p2 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = dan.sleep, y = dan.grump)) + geom_point() + geom_hline(yintercept = mean(df$dan.grump), color=&#39;blue&#39;) + geom_segment(aes(xend = dan.sleep, yend = dan.grump-resid_Ymean), alpha = .5, color=&#39;red&#39;) + # geom_point(aes(y = dan.grump+residuals), shape = 1) + theme_classic() + ggtitle(&quot;Residuals to the mean Y&quot;) p2 If we compare both graphs scatterplots side by side, it's pretty clear that our best-fit trendline is doing a much better job of predicting each datapoint's Y value. The horizontal trendline at the mean of Y looks pretty bad for the majority of datapoints - its residuals are much bigger. library(gridExtra) grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1) In fact, let's actually quantify the difference in residuals between these two trendlines. Because we have both positive and neagative residuals, if we just added them together we'd end up with 0. In statistics, one common way to make numbers positive is to square them. As we saw with standard deviation, this also has the advantage of emphasizing large values. What we do to compare our residuals, is to therefore square them. We call the residuals from our trendline the raw residuals. We call the residuals from the horizontal line the total residuals. df$residuals2 &lt;- df$residuals ^ 2 # raw residuals df$resid_Ymean2 &lt;- df$resid_Ymean ^ 2 # total residuals head(df[c(1,3,6,8,9,10)]) # just showing the relevant columns ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## dan.sleep dan.grump residuals resid_Ymean residuals2 resid_Ymean2 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7.59 56 -2.11 -7.71 4.43 59.4 ## 2 7.91 60 4.76 -3.71 22.6 13.8 ## 3 5.14 82 1.99 18.3 3.97 335. ## 4 7.71 55 -2.03 -8.71 4.13 75.9 ## 5 6.68 67 0.759 3.29 0.576 10.8 ## 6 5.99 72 -0.409 8.29 0.168 68.7 You can see the squared raw residual and squared total residual for the first six datapoints. Ideally, we want the raw residuals to be as small a fraction as possible of the total residuals. If we sum up the squared raw residuals and squared total residuals, we can determine this: SS.resid &lt;- sum(df$residuals2) SS.resid #1838.722 ## [1] 1838.75 SS.tot &lt;- sum(df$resid_Ymean2) SS.tot #9998.59 ## [1] 9998.59 As you can clearly see, the summed squared residuals for our best fit regression line are much smaller than the summed squared residuals when using the mean of y as the regression line. 11.3.4 Coefficient of Determination R2 One way to make these summed squares of residuals numbers more interpretable is to convert them to \\(R^{2}\\). The logic goes as following. If the trendline is absolutely useless at predicting the y values, then the trendline would have residuals as high as the total residuals. If the trendline is perfect at predicting the y values, then the residual SS total would be 0. If we look at the sum of the squares of the raw residuals as a ratio of a sum of the squared total residuals then we can work out how well our trendline fits. We calculate this using the formula, \\(R^{2} = 1 - \\frac{SS_{raw}}{SS_{total}}\\) in the following way: 1 - (SS.resid/SS.tot) # 0.816 (this is R2) ## [1] 0.816099 So for our data, \\(R^{2} = 0.816\\). This means that our regression model (and trendline) is a very good fit to the data. \\(R^{2}\\) ranges from 0 to 1. If its value was 1, then that would indicate that the best-fit trendline perfectly fits the data with no raw residuals. If its value was 0, then that would mean that the best-fit trendline is no better at fitting the data than the horizontal line at the mean of Y. Values of \\(R^{2}\\) that get closer to 1 indicate that the model is doing a better job at estimating each value of Y. We say that the model has a better 'fit' to the data. There is a way to directly get the value of \\(R^{2}\\) in R. You may remember earlier in this chapter that we ran our linear model using the function lm(). We saved the output of this regression model as the object mod1. You can use summary() to get lots of information about the regression model. summary(mod1) # the R2 matches ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = dan.grump ~ dan.sleep, data = df) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -11.025 -2.213 -0.399 2.681 11.750 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

This gives us the same value of \\(R^{2}\\) that we calculated by hand: \\(R^{2}=0.816\\). The other value of \\(R^{2}\\) is called Adjusted R-squared. This is relevant when you are conducting multiple regression with more than one predictor in the model. We only have one predictor in the model (dan.sleep) so we won't talk more about Adjusted R squared here. Finally, there is a shortcut way in which we can calculate \\(R^{2}\\). It is simply to square the Pearson's correlation coefficient: \\(R^{2} = r^{2}\\). r &lt;- cor(df$dan.sleep, df$dan.grump) r ## [1] -0.903384 r^2 # same R2 as above ## [1] 0.8161027 11.4 Standard Error of the Estimate \\(R^{2}\\) is one value that gives us a sense of how well our regression model is doing. Another method to assess 'model fit' is to examine the Standard Error of the Estimate. Unfortunately, this value has a number of names. You'll see it referred to as the Standard Error of the Regression, Residual Standard Error, Regression Standard Error, \\(S\\), or \\(\\sigma_{est}\\). We prefer to call it the Standard Error of the Estimate or \\(\\sigma_{est}\\). This is calculated as follows: \\(\\sigma_{est} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma (y - y&#39;)^{2}}{n-2}}\\) The \\(\\Sigma (y - y&#39;)^{2}\\) part of this equation is the Sum of the raw residuals squared that we already calculated when calculating \\(R^{2}\\). We can therefore calculate \\(\\sigma_{est}\\) quite straightforwardly in R manually. s_est &lt;- sqrt(SS.resid / 98) # n=100 s_est ## [1] 4.3316 Therefore \\(\\sigma_{est} = 4.332\\) for our model. It's acutally possible to see this value in the output of the summary of the model in R. Here, it's called the 'residual standard error': summary(mod1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = dan.grump ~ dan.sleep, data = df) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -11.025 -2.213 -0.399 2.681 11.750 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

What we are generally looking for with \\(\\sigma_{est}\\) is a number as small as possible. This is because what essentially it is a measure of is an approximate estimate of the average raw residual. The question is, how small is small? This is difficult to answer. One reason is because \\(\\sigma_{est}\\) is actually in the original units of the Y-axis (the outcome variable). Thefore it's not as simple as saying that it should be close to 0, because the Y-axis may be in units that are very large. In other ways, having this value in the original units of Y can be quite helpful as it is easy to envisage what the size of the average residual is. However, a good rule of thumb is that approximately 95% of the observations (raw datapoints) should fall within plus or minus 2 times the standard error of the estimates from the regression line. We can illustrate this with the following plot: ggplot(df, aes(x = dan.sleep, y = dan.grump)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + theme_classic() + geom_abline(intercept = 125.956+s_est+s_est, slope = -8.937, color = &#39;red&#39;, lty=2)+ geom_abline(intercept = 125.956-s_est-s_est, slope = -8.937, color = &#39;red&#39;, lty=2) + ggtitle(&quot;Regression with 2 x Standard Error of the Estimate&quot;) This is our original scatterplot again. The blue line is still the best fitting trendline. The two dashed red lines are two times \\(\\sigma_{est}\\) above and below the blue line respectively. That is they are 2 * 4.332 = 8.644 units of grumpiness above or below the trendline. If we count up the number of datapoints that our outside of the dotted red lines, we can see that there are six datapoints out of our 100 datapoints that are just outside, although some of htese are very close indeed to the red line. This is probably ok as we're only expecting 95% of datapoints on average to be inside the red lines. 11.5 Goodness of Fit Test - F-ratio \\(R^{2}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{est}\\) are two calculations that help us determine if our regression model (and trendline) is indeed a good fit to the data. A more formal method is to run a statistical test called the Goodness of Fit Test. To do this we calculate an F-ratio that essentially examines how well our trendline (and model) fit the data compared to the null model which is the model where we use the mean of Y as our prediction. As a reminder, these scatterplots show the difference in performance of our fitted model (left) compared to the null model (right). grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1) The F-ratio is essentially a method of determining the proportion of residual variance compared to total variance. We can calculate it using the following formula: $F = $ Here, SSM refers to the sum of squares for the model (the model sum of squares). This is equal to: \\(SSM = SST - SSR\\) That is, it's the difference between the total sum of squares (the sum of the squared residuals for the null model) minus the residual sum of squares (the sum of the squared residuals for the fitted model). The d.f.SSM refers to the degrees of freedom for the model sum of squares, which is equal to the number of predictors in the model. We only have one predictor (dan.sleep), so that means the degrees of freedom are 1. The d.f.SSR refers to the degrees of freedom for the raw residuals. This is equal to the number of observations minus the number of predictors minus 1. Therefore it is equal to 100 - 1 - 1 = 98 as we had 100 datapoints (or obsevations). Let's calculate this in R. Firstly, we'll calculate the model sum of squares: SS.mod &lt;- SS.tot - SS.resid SS.mod #8159.868 ## [1] 8159.84 Next we divide the model sum of squares and the residual sum of squares by their respective degrees of freedom to get the mean sum of squares for each. \\(F\\) is then calculated by dividing the former by the latter: MS.resid &lt;- SS.resid / 98 MS.resid #18.76 ## [1] 18.76276 MS.mod &lt;- SS.mod / 1 MS.mod #8159.868 ## [1] 8159.84 Fval &lt;- MS.mod / MS.resid Fval #434.9 ## [1] 434.8955 So \\(F = 434.9\\) which is a large value. Larger values indicate that we were less likely to get a difference between the sum of squares for our fitted and null models by chance alone. Essentially, the observed value of F is compared to the sampling distribution for F if the null hypothesis is true. The null is that our model (trendline) is no better than random in fitting the datapoints Whether our \\(F\\) value is sufficiently large can be looked up in an F-table (not recommended), or you can simply let R do the work for you. If you use summary() on your saved regression model, it will give you the \\(F\\) value as well as a p-value to go along with it. summary(mod1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = dan.grump ~ dan.sleep, data = df) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -11.025 -2.213 -0.399 2.681 11.750 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The p-value here is 0.0000000000000022 which is basically 0. Typically, if the p-value is less than 0.05 we will say that our fitted model is a better fit to the data than the null model. 11.6 Assumptions of Linear Regression Even if your model is a good fit to the data, there are still several things you need to check before progressing to examining whether your predictor is 'significantly' (a better term is probably 'meaningfully') predicting the outcome variable. The last series of things we need to do is to check whether we have violated the assumptions of linear regression. In short, here are some of the assumptions that we need to adhere to: Normality - Specifically the residuals are normally distributed. Linearity - We need to be examining linear relationships between predictors and outcomes Homogeneity of Variance (homoscedasticity) Uncorrelated Predictors (only relevant if doing more than one predictor) No overly influential datapoints Let's discuss each of these in turn. 11.6.1 Normality of Residuals One assumption of linear regression is that our residuals are approximately normally distributed. We can check this in several ways. But first, we should probably own up and mention that there are several types of residuals. The residuals we have been dealing with from the regression model have been the raw residuals. We got these by simply subtracting the predicted value of y from the observed value of y \\(residual = y - y&#39;\\). However, statisticians like to modify these residuals. One modification they make is to turn these residuals into what are called standardized residuals. These are the raw residuals divided by the standard deviation of the residuals. You can directly access the standardized residuals in R by using the rstandard() function with your model output: df$std_resids &lt;- rstandard(mod1) head(df[c(1,3,6,11)]) # just showing the relevant columns ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## dan.sleep dan.grump residuals std_resids ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 7.59 56 -2.11 -0.494 ## 2 7.91 60 4.76 1.10 ## 3 5.14 82 1.99 0.467 ## 4 7.71 55 -2.03 -0.478 ## 5 6.68 67 0.759 0.172 ## 6 5.99 72 -0.409 -0.0991 We can demonstrate that the standardized residuals really are highly correlated with the raw residuals by plotting them on a scatterplot: ggplot(df, aes(x=residuals, y=std_resids)) + geom_point() + theme_classic()+ xlab(&quot;Raw Residuals&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Standardized Residuals&quot;) They are effectively the same - just transformed. One advantage of standardized residuals is that they can help us look for unusual datapoints with large residuals. While raw residuals are always in the original units of the y-axis, standardized residuals are, well, standardized. Standardized residuals that are greater than 2 or less than -2 are quite large, those that are larger than 3 or less than 3 are very large indeed and should be looked at in more detail. Let's get back to checking the normality of these residuals. First up, we could plot a histogram and see if we think it's approximately normal: #a) histogram plot ggplot(df, aes(x=std_resids)) + geom_histogram(color=&#39;white&#39;) # possibly ok ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. This looks possibly ok. It's not too skewed, but it can be harded from a histogram with just 100 datapoints to get a sense of the shape. A second approach would be to use a Shapiro-Wilk test which more formally test whether the data are approximately normally distributed: #b) Shapiro-Wilk test shapiro.test(df$std_resids) # shapiro test says normal. ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: df$std_resids ## W = 0.99201, p-value = 0.8221 Given that the p-value here is above our cut-off of 0.05, this suggests that we have no evidence to reject the hypothesis that our data came from a normal distribution. An easier way of saying this is, our residuals are likey approximately normally distributed. The other method we can employ to check normality is to use a QQ plot: #c) QQ plot qqnorm(df$std_resids) qqline(df$std_resids, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) # it&#39;s ok A discussion of precisely what these QQ plots are is beyond the scope here. However, in general terms, what we are plotting is the residual against the theoretical value of each residual that we would expect if our data were normally distributed. In practical terms, what we're looking for is that the bulk of our data fit along the blue line. It's ok to have a bit of wobble at the extremes - that just means that our data distribution probably has slightly fat tails. It's also possible to generate a version of the above plot quickly, directly from the saved linear model object. plot( x = mod1, which = 2 ) # fast way of getting same plot 11.6.2 2. Linearity --- The second major assumption of linear regression is that the relationship between our predictor and outcome is linear! So, data that look like the following would not have a linear relationship. comparing a and b One simple approach is to examine the scatterplot of your predictor (X) and outcome (Y) variables. We already did this, and our data looked pretty linear! Another approach is to examine the relationship between your observed Y values and the predicted Y values \\(y&#39;\\). This should also be a linear relationship. Although we calculated the \\(y&#39;\\) values earlier using the formula for the regression line, we can actually grab them directly from the model object with the fitted.values() command. df$Y.fitted &lt;- fitted.values(mod1) # plot this relationship ggplot(df, aes(x = Y.fitted, y = dan.grump)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;, se=F) As you can see from this plot, our fitted (predicted) values of Y on the x-axis have a strong linear relationship with our observed values of Y on the y-axis. 11.6.3 3. Homogeneity of Variance / Homoscedasticity The third assumption that we need to check is homoscedasticity (also sometimes referred to as homogeneity of variance). What this really means is that the model should be equally good at predicting Y's across all values of X. Our regression model shouldn't be better at predicting values of Y for e.g. small values of X but not for large values of X. Practically, what this means, is that the size of the residuals should be equal across all values of X. If we plot the values of X (or the predicted/fitted values of Y) on the x-axis against the residuals (in this case standardized residuals) on the Y-axis, then there should be no overall pattern. We should be equally likely to get small or large residuals for any value of X (or predicted/fitted value of Y). This would mean that any trendline on this graph should be a horizontal line. # if true, this should be a straight line ggplot(df, aes(x = Y.fitted, y = std_resids)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&#39;lm&#39;, se=F) As you can see, our plot is basically a random scatterplot and there is no overall pattern. That is good, it means we have homoscedasticity. If we did not have homoscedasticity, then we'd see a pattern in this scatterplot - such as the residuals getting larger or smaller for larger fitted (predicted) values of Y. You can access a version of this plot directly from the model object like this: plot(mod1, which = 3) There are some more formal tests of homoscedasticity but we don't need to worry about them. 11.6.4 No Colinearity This assumption of linear regression only applies when we have more than one predictor in the model. In our model, we do only have one predictor (dan.sleep) so we don't need to worry about it. If we had added in another variable into the model, e.g. the amount of hours of baby sleep, then we'd have a second predictor. That means, we're trying to predict dan.grump based on both dan.sleep and baby.sleep. In this case, dan.sleep and baby.sleep should not be correlated with each other. 11.6.5 Unusual Datapoints There are a number of ways that datapoints could be unusual. We will discuss data points that are: outliers have high leverage have high influence Generally linear regression models should not be overly affected by individual data points. Usually the category that we most need to be concerned about are points with high influence. 11.6.5.1 i. Outliers Outliers are datapoints that are typically highly unusual in terms of outcome Y but not in terms of the predictor X. These will be datapoints that have high residuals. Let's look at an example dataset. We have a predictor 'x' and an outcome 'y'. With 'y1' we have the same outcome variables, but have removed the value for one datapoint: x &lt;- c(4.1,4.2,5,5.5,6,6.1,6.15,6.4,7,7.2,7.7,8,9.7) y &lt;- c(3.9,4.3,6,5.9,6.1,11.9,6.3,5.8,7.9,6.4,7.8,8,9.1) y1 &lt;- c(3.9,4.3,6,5.9,6.1,NA,6.3,5.8,7.9,6.4,7.8,8,9.1) ddf &lt;- data.frame(x,y,y1) ddf ## x y y1 ## 1 4.10 3.9 3.9 ## 2 4.20 4.3 4.3 ## 3 5.00 6.0 6.0 ## 4 5.50 5.9 5.9 ## 5 6.00 6.1 6.1 ## 6 6.10 11.9 NA ## 7 6.15 6.3 6.3 ## 8 6.40 5.8 5.8 ## 9 7.00 7.9 7.9 ## 10 7.20 6.4 6.4 ## 11 7.70 7.8 7.8 ## 12 8.00 8.0 8.0 ## 13 9.70 9.1 9.1 And here, we're plotting the best fitting regression line in blue. The dotted red line represents the best fitting trendline that we would have if we removed the datapoints that has the y value of 11.9. The dashed black line shows the distance from this datapoint to the trendline we would have if it was removed. ## (Intercept) x ## 0.8247787 0.8785270 As you can see from this small example, outliers are datapoints that have very large residuals from the trendline. They have an unusually large Y. Notice though that the slope of the trendline hasn't change too much at all. It is slighly shifted down after you remove that outlier from the calculations, but overall the coefficient of 'b' is similar to before. This type of outlier is not necessarily a big deal. 11.6.5.2 ii. High Leverage Datapoints that have high leverage are those that have a high influence on the regression line's trajectory, but don't necessarily affect the angle of the slope. They are typically unsual in terms of their X value, but not necessarily in terms of Y, meaning that they don't have to have a high residual. We can measure the leverage of datapoints using the function hatvalues() on the model object. For the scatterplot above, the hat values of each datapoint can be calculated as follows: mod.out &lt;- lm(y~x, data = ddf) ddf$hat_val &lt;- hatvalues(mod.out) ddf ## x y y1 hat_val ## 1 4.10 3.9 3.9 0.25535302 ## 2 4.20 4.3 4.3 0.24009985 ## 3 5.00 6.0 6.0 0.14260536 ## 4 5.50 5.9 5.9 0.10381722 ## 5 6.00 6.1 6.1 0.08206442 ## 6 6.10 11.9 NA 0.07975810 ## 7 6.15 6.3 6.3 0.07886047 ## 8 6.40 5.8 5.8 0.07692761 ## 9 7.00 7.9 7.9 0.08966480 ## 10 7.20 6.4 6.4 0.09936183 ## 11 7.70 7.8 7.8 0.13552914 ## 12 8.00 8.0 8.0 0.16540649 ## 13 9.70 9.1 9.1 0.45055168 As you can see, the 6th datapoint was the outlier but it does not have a large leverage as it's not overly influencing the trajectory of the regression line. Datapoint 13 on the other hand does have a higher leverage. Roughly speaking, a large hatvalue is one which is 2-3 times the average hat value. We can check the mean of the hat values like this: mean(hatvalues(mod.out)) ## [1] 0.1538462 So clearly, the 13th datapoint does have a high leverage. 11.6.5.3 iii. High Influence The third type of unusual datapoint are ones that you need to be most wary of. These are datapoints that have high influence. Essentially a high influence datapoint is a high leverage datapoint that is also an outlier. Let's look at these example data. We are looking at a predictor variable 'x' against an outcome variable 'y2'. 'y3' is the same data as 'y2' with one datapoint's value removed. x &lt;- c(4.1,4.2,5,5.5,6,6.15,6.4,7,7.2,7.7,8,9.7) y2 &lt;- c(3.9,4.3,6,5.9,6.1,6.3,5.8,7.9,6.4,7.8,8,6.1) y3 &lt;- c(3.9,4.3,6,5.9,6.1,6.3,5.8,7.9,6.4,7.8,8,NA) ddf1 &lt;- data.frame(x,y2,y3) ddf1 ## x y2 y3 ## 1 4.10 3.9 3.9 ## 2 4.20 4.3 4.3 ## 3 5.00 6.0 6.0 ## 4 5.50 5.9 5.9 ## 5 6.00 6.1 6.1 ## 6 6.15 6.3 6.3 ## 7 6.40 5.8 5.8 ## 8 7.00 7.9 7.9 ## 9 7.20 6.4 6.4 ## 10 7.70 7.8 7.8 ## 11 8.00 8.0 8.0 ## 12 9.70 6.1 NA Let's plot these data - I'm sparing you the code for this plot: What you can see here is the scatterplot of 'x' against 'y2'. The blue trendline is the best fit line to the regression of 'x' against 'y2'. The red dotted line is the regression line when we remove the datapoint at x=9.7. This datapoint has both high leverage and is an outlier (has an overly large residual). As a consequence of this, when you remove this datapoint it significantly shifts the angle of the slope of the regression line. That means that the value of b changes quite considerably. Let's add the hat values (measuring leverage) to the data. We can also add what is called Cook's Distance which is a measure of the influence of each datapoint. mod.out2 &lt;- lm(y2~x, data = ddf1) ddf1$hat_val &lt;- hatvalues(mod.out2) ddf1$cooks_d &lt;-cooks.distance(mod.out2) ddf1 ## x y2 y3 hat_val cooks_d ## 1 4.10 3.9 3.9 0.26609280 0.2940686663 ## 2 4.20 4.3 4.3 0.25062833 0.1201644267 ## 3 5.00 6.0 6.0 0.15151904 0.0347793264 ## 4 5.50 5.9 5.9 0.11178988 0.0026090653 ## 5 6.00 6.1 6.1 0.08914853 0.0007585906 ## 6 6.15 6.3 6.3 0.08568825 0.0029898530 ## 7 6.40 5.8 5.8 0.08333867 0.0085341275 ## 8 7.00 7.9 7.9 0.09512926 0.1169635836 ## 9 7.20 6.4 6.4 0.10452756 0.0038328585 ## 10 7.70 7.8 7.8 0.13998476 0.0808111497 ## 11 8.00 8.0 8.0 0.16946124 0.1138881520 ## 12 9.70 6.1 NA 0.45269169 2.8757588661 As you can see, datapoint 12 (x=9.7) has high leverage and it's also an outlier. Consequently it has a very large Cook's Distance. Typically a Cook's distance &gt; 1 requires more consideration about how to proceed with your model. You can also quickly get a plot of the Cook's Distances of all datapoints from a regression model like this: plot(mod.out2, which = 4) 11.6.5.4 Checking Influence: Let's look for influential datapoints in our Sleep vs Grumpiness Data. At the beginning of this section, we saved the linear model as mod. We can look at the Cook's Distances with the cooks.distance() function, or we could just plot them: plot(mod1, which = 4) This plot shows each of our 100 datapoints in the order they appear in the original dataframe along the x-axis. Clearly, looking at the y-axis, all our datapoints have Cook's distances of far below 1, so we are fine to assume that we have no overly influential datapoints. 11.7 Examining individual predictor estimates After checking if our model is a good fit and making sure that we did not violate any of the assumptions of the linear regression, we can finally move forward with what we came here to do. That is, we can check whether our predictor is meaningfully useful in predicting our outcome variable. This means, is our observed value of b sufficiently different from 0? To do this, we use two strategies. First, we can generate a 95% confidence interval around our estimate of b. That is the method that we prefer. Secondly, you can run a significance test. 11.7.1 95% confidence interval of 'b'. First, let's do this the easy way. Then we'll work out how we got the 95% confidence interval. You can simply find this by running the confint() function on our regression model object: # easy way - gives us the confidence interval: coefficients(mod1) ## (Intercept) dan.sleep ## 125.956292 -8.936756 confint(object = mod1, level = .95) ## 2.5 % 97.5 % ## (Intercept) 119.971000 131.94158 ## dan.sleep -9.787161 -8.08635 This tells us that the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of b is -9.79, and the upper bound is -8.09, with our estimate of b being -8.94. This means that if we were to sample 100 days randomly over and over again and measure Dan's sleep and grumpiness on these days, in 95% of the samples we collect we would have the true population parameter value of b. In lay terms, we can suggest that there is approximately a 95% likelihood that this true population value of b is between -9.79 and -8.09. The only way to really get the true population value would have been to measure Dan's sleep and grumpiness for every day that Dan has been alive. In big picture terms, what we can draw from this 95% confidence interval is that the relationship between sleep and grumpiness is highly negative and clearly strong. There really seems to be close to no chance that 0 could be the value of b - it is not inside the confidence interval. In fact, we could generate a ridiculously confidence confidence interval, such as a 99.9999% confidence interval: confint(object = mod1, level = .999999) ## 0.00005 % 99.99995 % ## (Intercept) 110.21037 141.702208 ## dan.sleep -11.17398 -6.699536 ... and 0 is still nowhere near being included. How is this 95% confidence interval calculated? To do this we need to think about those sampling distributions again, and the standard error of b. 11.7.2 Standard Error of b As we've discussed earlier, our one single estimate of b is just one possible estimate. We estimated this value based on our one single sample of 100 days. However, if we had sampled a different sample of 100 days, we would have got a slighlty (or maybe greatly) different estimate of b. If we repeated this procedure thousands of times, then we'd have a sampling distribution of b's. This sampling distribution will be t-distribution shaped and has degrees of freedom = number of observations - the number of predictors (1) - 1. Therefore it is t-distribution shaped with d.f.=98. If we know the standard deviation of this sampling distribution (which is known as the standard error of b - \\(s_{b}\\)), then we can create confidence intervals. However, it turns out that calculating \\(s_{b}\\) is a bit annoying. Fortunately, there is a quick way to find it out by looking at the summary of the model output: summary(mod1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = dan.grump ~ dan.sleep, data = df) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -11.025 -2.213 -0.399 2.681 11.750 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 125.9563 3.0161 41.76 &lt;2e-16 *** ## dan.sleep -8.9368 0.4285 -20.85 &lt;2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Residual standard error: 4.332 on 98 degrees of freedom ## Multiple R-squared: 0.8161, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8142 ## F-statistic: 434.9 on 1 and 98 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16 We can see here that \\(s_{b} = 0.4285\\) If you're interested, then this is the formula to calculate \\(s_{b}\\): \\(s_{b} = \\frac{\\sigma_{est}}{\\sqrt{\\Sigma (x - \\overline{x})}}\\) Here's how we calculate it by hand according to this formula: x_dif &lt;- df$dan.sleep - mean(df$dan.sleep) # difference of each x from mean of x ssx &lt;- sqrt(sum(x_dif^2)) # square root of the sum of these differences squared sb &lt;- s_est/ssx #s_est was calculated earlier sb # this is the standard error of b ## [1] 0.4285351 11.7.3 Calculating 95% confidence interval of 'b' by hand We can use the following formula to calculate the 95% CI for b: \\(CI_{95} = b +/- t * s_{b}\\) As with all confidence intervals, what we do is to presume that our estimate of b is the mean of the sampling distribution. Then knowing that the distribution is t-shaped with d.f.=98, we need to find the value of t that will leave 2.5% of the distribution in each tail. We can look that up in R using qt: tval &lt;- qt(.975, df = 98) tval ## [1] 1.984467 We've now calculated everyting we need to for the Confidence Interval b + (tval * sb) #upper bound ## [1] -8.086342 b - (tval * sb) # lower bound ## [1] -9.78717 As we can see, these match up with the output when using confint(): confint(mod1) ## 2.5 % 97.5 % ## (Intercept) 119.971000 131.94158 ## dan.sleep -9.787161 -8.08635 11.7.4 Signifcance Testing b We can also use this sampling distribution to apply a signifiance test. Our null hypothesis will be that the population value of b is 0. Our alternative hypothesis will be that b is not equal to 0. \\(H_{0}: b=0\\). \\(H_{1}: b\\neq0\\) Given we know the standard deviation of this sampling distribution, \\(s_{b}\\), we can calculate how far away our observed sample value of \\(b\\) is in terms of how many standard deviations from the mean of 0 it is. We call this value a t-statistic and it is calculated like this: \\(t = \\frac{b}{s_{b}}\\) Once we have calculated our t-statistic, then we can determine given the shape of the distribution and the degrees of freedom, what proportion of the distribution is more extreme than our observed value. tobs &lt;- b/sb tobs #-20.854 ## [1] -20.8542 Our observed value is therefore \\(t = -20.854\\). Let's look at this graphically: comparing a and b This shows the t-distribution for d.f. = 98. It looks very strange because we've extended the axes to -21 and +21. We did this so that we could include a dotted blue line for our observed t-value of -20.854. Notice that by the time the t-distribution of d.f.=98 gets to close to a value of t=-3 then there is almost nothing left in the tail of the distribution. Just for completeness, we can calculate what proportion of times we observe a t-value of more extreme (i.e. less than) -20.854 using pt(). pt(-20.854, df=98) ## [1] 4.094577e-38 This essentially gives us a one-tailed p-value of p = 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000004094577, which is very small. To get a 2-tailed p-value we just double this value. Essentially what we can conclude here is that our one value of b is extremely unlikely to have come from a population where b=0, and thus we reject our null hypothesis and accept the alternative. The preceding information was provided to help you think about what's really going on when we calculate the t-statistic. However, tt turns out there is actually a shortcut way of calculating t using n and the Pearson's correlation coefficient r. It's the following formula: \\(t = \\frac{r \\times \\sqrt{n-2}}{\\sqrt{1 - r^{2}}}\\) r &lt;- cor(df$dan.sleep, df$dan.grump) n &lt;- nrow(df) (r * sqrt(n-2)) / (sqrt(1-r^2)) # -20.85 ## [1] -20.8544 As you can see from the above code - it works!

This is just calculated by subtracting one sample mean from the other: meandif &lt;- mean(anastasia) - mean(bernadette) # 5.48 meandif ## [1] 5.477778 So, from our samples, we observed a difference in grades of 5.48 between the groups. Typically, we would run an independent t-test to test whether these two samples came from theoretical populations that differ in their means: t.test(anastasia, bernadette, var.equal = T) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: anastasia and bernadette ## t = 2.1154, df = 31, p-value = 0.04253 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.1965873 10.7589683 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 74.53333 69.05556 This Student's t-test (notice var.equal=T) suggests that this is a significant difference, meaning that the groups do differ in their population means. However, this test relies on several assumptions (see section xx.x.x). Instead, we could apply a permutation test that is free of assumptions. Essentially what we are going to do is ask how surprising it was to get a difference of 5.48 given our real data. Put another way, if we shuffled the data into different groups of 15 and 18 (the respective sample sizes of Anastasia and Bernadette), would we get a difference in sample means of greater or lower than 5.48? If we did this thousands of times, how many times would we get differences in sample means above 5.48? Let's apply this theory to just one permutation. First, we combine all the data: set.seed(1) # just to keep the random number generator the same for all of us allscores &lt;- c(anastasia, bernadette) allscores ## [1] 65 74 73 83 76 65 86 70 80 55 78 78 90 77 68 72 66 71 66 76 69 79 73 62 69 ## [26] 68 60 73 68 67 74 56 74 Next, we shuffle them into new groups of 15 and 18.: x &lt;- split(sample(allscores), rep(1:2, c(15,18))) x ## $`1` ## [1] 80 78 71 73 65 68 67 74 72 74 76 83 68 70 69 ## ## $`2` ## [1] 74 90 69 68 78 66 73 76 62 56 79 65 60 73 55 77 66 86 We have two brand new samples that contain all of the scores from our original data, but they've just been shuffled around. We could look at what the difference in sample means is between these two new samples: x[[1]] # this is our shuffled sample of size 15 ## [1] 80 78 71 73 65 68 67 74 72 74 76 83 68 70 69 x[[2]] # this is our shuffled sample of size 18 ## [1] 74 90 69 68 78 66 73 76 62 56 79 65 60 73 55 77 66 86 mean(x[[1]]) # mean of the new sample of size 15 ## [1] 72.53333 mean(x[[2]]) # mean of the new sample of size 18 ## [1] 70.72222 # what&#39;s the difference in their means? mean(x[[1]]) - mean(x[[2]]) ## [1] 1.811111 The difference in sample means is 1.81, which is a lot smaller than our original difference in sample means. Let's do this same process 10,000 times! Don't worry too much about the details of the code. What we are doing is the above process, just putting it in a loop and asking it to do it 10,000 times. We save all the results in an object called results. results&lt;-vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ x &lt;- split(sample(allscores), rep(1:2, c(15,18))) results[[i]]&lt;-mean(x[[1]]) - mean(x[[2]]) } head(unlist(results)) # these are all our mean differences from 10,000 shuffles of the data. We&#39;re just looking at the first 6. ## [1] -1.8555556 -2.5888889 4.0111111 -3.9333333 0.2222222 3.5222222 We can actually make a histogram showing the distribution of these differences in sample means. df &lt;- data.frame(difs = unlist(results)) ggplot(df, aes(x=difs)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;green&quot;, alpha=.4) + geom_vline(color=&quot;navy&quot;,lwd=1,lty=2,xintercept = 5.48) + theme_classic()+ ggtitle(&quot;Mean Differences from \\n 10000 Permutations of Raw Data&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. This histogram shows that for some of our 10,000 shuffles, we actually got some differences between our two samples of higher than 5.48 (the dotted blue line), but the vast majority of shuffles led to samples that had mean differences lower than 5.48. In fact, several shuffles led to samples where the sample of size 18 (Bernadette in the original data) had a sample mean that was higher than the sample of size 15 (Anastasia in the original data). We can directly calculate how many times out of 10,000 shuffles we got a difference in sample means that was greater than 5.48 sum(unlist(results) &gt; 5.48) # 202 times out of 10000 ## [1] 215 To convert this to a p-value, we simply divide this value by the number of shuffles we ran - which was 10,000. sum(unlist(results) &gt; 5.48) /10000 # which is 0.0202 proportion of the time ## [1] 0.0215 So our p-value is p=0.0215 which is similar to a one-tailed p-value. Example 2: Let's take a look at a second example. Here, we have various subjects rating their anxiety levels. They do this after either taking a new anxiolytic drug or a placebo. The subjects in each group are independent of each other. The placebo group has 19 subjects and the drug group has 21 subjects. The data: placebo &lt;- c(15, 16, 19, 19, 17, 20, 18, 14, 18, 20, 20, 20, 13, 11, 16, 19, 19, 16, 10) drug &lt;- c(15, 15, 16, 13, 11, 19, 17, 17, 11, 14, 10, 18, 19, 14, 13, 16, 16, 17, 14, 10, 14) length(placebo) #19 ## [1] 19 length(drug) #21 ## [1] 21 If we were interested in doing a Student's t-test, we might want to check whether the data are approximately normal. We could perform Shapiro-Wilk tests to do this: shapiro.test(drug) # approximately normal as p&gt;.05 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: drug ## W = 0.95184, p-value = 0.3688 shapiro.test(placebo) # not enough evidence to be normal as p&lt;.05 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: placebo ## W = 0.88372, p-value = 0.02494 From this we find that the placebo group is not approximately normally distributed (p value of the Shapiro-Wilk test is &lt;.05). We could do a non-parametric test such as Wilcoxon Ranked Sum test (see xxx.xxx), but an alternative strategy is to perform a permutation test. Let's first plot the data, and then look at our observed difference in anxiety scores between our two independent samples: # put into dataframe - long format df &lt;- data.frame(anxiety = c(placebo, drug), group = c(rep(&quot;placebo&quot;, length(placebo)), rep(&quot;drug&quot;, length(drug)) ) ) head(df) ## anxiety group ## 1 15 placebo ## 2 16 placebo ## 3 19 placebo ## 4 19 placebo ## 5 17 placebo ## 6 20 placebo #boxplots ggplot(df, aes(x=group, y=anxiety, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha=.4) + geom_jitter(width=.1) + theme_classic() + scale_fill_manual(values=c(&quot;orange&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;)) mean(placebo) - mean(drug) #2.128 ## [1] 2.12782 So our observed difference in sample means is 2.128. In the permutation test, what we'll do is shuffle all the scores randomly between the two groups, creating new samples of the same size (19 and 21). Then we'll see what difference in sample means we get from those shuffled groups. We'll also do this 10,000 times. allvalues &lt;- c(placebo, drug) results&lt;-vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ x &lt;- split(sample(allvalues), rep(1:2, c(19,21))) results[[i]]&lt;-mean(x[[1]]) - mean(x[[2]]) } head(unlist(results)) # these are the first six of all our mean differences from 10,000 shuffles of the data. ## [1] -0.8796992 -0.7794486 -1.2807018 -0.4786967 2.5288221 1.1253133 Let's plot the distribution of these data to see what proportion of times our shuffled groups got samples that were greater than 2.128. df0 &lt;- data.frame(difs = unlist(results)) ggplot(df0, aes(x=difs)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;pink&quot;, alpha=.4) + geom_vline(color=&quot;navy&quot;,lwd=1,lty=2,xintercept = 2.128) + theme_classic()+ ggtitle(&quot;Mean Differences from \\n 10000 Permutations of Raw Data&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. It looks like very few times did we get two samples that had differences in sample means that were greater than 2.128. We can calculate exactly how many times, and express this as the proportion of times we got a difference in sample means greater than 2.128: sum(unlist(results) &gt; 2.128) # 109 times out of 10000 ## [1] 113 sum(unlist(results) &gt; 2.128) /10000 # which is 0.0109 proportion of the time ## [1] 0.0113 So, in this case we can say that the probability of getting a difference in sample means between the drug and placebo groups that was larger than our observed difference of 2.128 was p = 0.0109. This is very strong evidence that the observed difference is significantly greater than we'd expect by chance. 12.2 Correlation Coefficient Permutation Tests You can apply the logic of permutation tests to almost any statistical test. Let's look at an example for Pearson correlations. In these data, we are looking at 15 subjects who are completing a task. We measured the time they spent on the task and their high scores. library(tidyverse) df &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/timescore.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## subject = col_character(), ## time = col_double(), ## score = col_double() ## ) head(df) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## subject time score ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1A 5.5 3 ## 2 2B 2.4 6.9 ## 3 3C 8.8 17.9 ## 4 4D 7 10.5 ## 5 5E 9.3 12.2 ## 6 6F 2.5 3.5 If we make a scatterplot of the data, we can see that those who spent longer on the task tended to get higher scores: # scatterplot ggplot(df, aes(x = time, y = score)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se=F) Using a standard approach, we could find the correlation of these two variables and run a signficance test using cor.test(). We can see that there is a moderate Pearson's r of r=0.55 which is statistically significant (p=0.031). # regular significance test cor.test(df$time,df$score) #r=0.55, p=0.031 ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: df$time and df$score ## t = 2.4258, df = 13, p-value = 0.03057 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.0643515 0.8324385 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5582129 We could take an alternative tack, and decide to do a permutation test. The idea here is again, how surprising is it to get a correlation of 0.55 with these data? Were there other ways of ordering the x and y variables to get higher correlation coefficients? Let's look at our y axis variable, the score: set.seed(1) # just doing this so all our results look same df$score # actual data in order ## [1] 3.0 6.9 17.9 10.5 12.2 3.5 11.0 7.6 8.4 13.4 10.1 9.0 10.1 17.7 6.8 This is the original order of the data. If we use sample() we can shuffle the data: sample(df$score) # actual data but order shuffled ## [1] 10.5 3.5 7.6 10.1 17.9 8.4 13.4 17.7 12.2 3.0 6.9 10.1 9.0 6.8 11.0 Let's shuffle the score again, but this time store it in the original dataframe: df$shuffle1 &lt;- sample(df$score) #create a new column with shuffled data df ## # A tibble: 15 x 4 ## subject time score shuffle1 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1A 5.5 3 7.6 ## 2 2B 2.4 6.9 10.1 ## 3 3C 8.8 17.9 10.1 ## 4 4D 7 10.5 12.2 ## 5 5E 9.3 12.2 8.4 ## 6 6F 2.5 3.5 13.4 ## 7 7G 4.8 11 6.9 ## 8 8H 4.1 7.6 3.5 ## 9 9I 5 8.4 3 ## 10 10J 2.9 13.4 17.7 ## 11 11K 6.4 10.1 6.8 ## 12 12L 7.7 9 11 ## 13 13M 9.3 10.1 9 ## 14 14N 8.3 17.7 17.9 ## 15 15O 5.1 6.8 10.5 If we plot this shuffled y (score) against the original x (time), we now get this scatterplot, which basically shows no relationship: # this is what that new column looks like: ggplot(df, aes(x = time, y = shuffle1)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se=F) And the correlation for this new scatterplot is really close to 0! r = 0.0005: cor.test(df$time, df$shuffle1) # now relationship is a bit negative ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: df$time and df$shuffle1 ## t = 0.0016429, df = 13, p-value = 0.9987 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.5119267 0.5125988 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.0004556502 We could shuffle the score variable even more times, and directly calculate the r value aginst the time variable for each shuffle using cor(). # we can do this many times cor(df$time, sample(df$score)) # r = 0.35 ## [1] 0.3023584 cor(df$time, sample(df$score)) # r = 0.04 ## [1] -0.05905503 cor(df$time, sample(df$score)) # r = -0.06 ## [1] -0.4665168 cor(df$time, sample(df$score)) # r = 0.15 ## [1] -0.435933 As you can see, the more shuffles we do, we get varied values of r. What we really should do is perform 10,000 (or another really high number) shuffles of the score variable and re-calculate r against the time variable for all 10,000 of these shuffles. Don't worry about the code below, but that's exactly what we're doing. We're saving the r values from the 10,000 shuffles in the object called results. results &lt;- vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ results[[i]] &lt;- cor(df$time, sample(df$score)) } head(unlist(results)) # this are the correlations for the first 6 of 10,000 shuffles ## [1] 0.274190962 0.005288304 -0.114492469 -0.280528642 0.235874922 ## [6] 0.061278049 We can plot the results in a histogram, and also put a vertical line at 0.56 which was our original observed correlation between time and score from the raw unshuffled data. results.df &lt;- data.frame(x = unlist(results)) ggplot(results.df, aes(x)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;,fill=&quot;lightseagreen&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0.56, lwd=1, lty=2) + xlab(&quot;r&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. As you can see, there were a few shuffles (or permutations) that we got an r value of greater than 0.56, but not that many. In fact, we can directly calculate how many: sum(unlist(results) &gt; 0.56) #163 were greater. ## [1] 163 It turns out that 163 times out of 10,000 shuffles we got a r value of greater than 0.56. WE could calculate this as a proportion by dividing by 10,000: sum(unlist(results) &gt; 0.56) / 10000 #0.0163 ## [1] 0.0163 We can use this value as our p-value. Because it is relatively low, we could argue that we were very unlikely by chance alone to have got a r value of 0.56 from our data. This suggests that the correlation between time and score is significant. The advantages of running a permutation test is that it is free of the assumptions of normality for the Pearson's r correlation signifiance test. It's also a cool method, and pretty intuitive. "]
