The initial steps are downloading and installing R. This may differ slightly based on your machine. 2.2 Downloading R Go to the R website. The first box has options for downloading R for Mac, Windows or Linux. Click on the appropriate link. Then you will want to click on \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{&quot;install R for the first time&quot;}}\\). Then follow the instructions. 2.3 Downloading RStudio Go to the Rstudio website. Click DOWNLOAD under RStudio Desktop, open source license FREE. Then click on the appropriate installer for your computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux). Run the installer and follow the instructions. You will always use Rstudio, when working with data. 2.4 Using RCloud instead of RStudio blah blah blah DO we really need this? RCloud 2.5 Importing Data There are different options for importing data. It’s possible to import data of all different formats into RStudio. We will primarily use spreadsheet type files that have been saved with the “.csv” suffix. These are called ‘comma separated files’. Option 1. Import Tab You can click on the “Import Dataset” tab in the top right of RStudio - it’s located just above your global environment. Tyler - perhaps we can insert images here? like this Of course, we should look into how to chaneg image sizes. You then need to click on the appropriate file type that you wish to import. As I mentioned, nearly all our files will be “.csv” files, so you should click on “From CSV”. In other versions of RStudio, this may say “from text (readR)” instead. blah blah blah not sure what else you want here? I can’t remember how to insert more space between sections, so I just write to try and force space. Option 2. Writing code. This is the option that we will use in our scripts for this course. You may notice that all the datasets that we wish to use are in a folder called “data”. To read in any of these datasets, what we need to do is use the read_csv() function. This comes from a package contained with the tidyverse package, so we must have imported that library first. We then tell it which dataset to find within the ‘data’ folder. We use the notation “data/…” to tell it to look inside the data folder. For instance, if we wished to load in the bmi.csv dataset, and assign it the name bmi, we would do it like this - make sure to put quotes around the whole file name and location: library(tidyverse) #load package bmi &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/bmi.csv&quot;) # bring in data head(bmi) # first six rows ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## id age bmi chol insulin dbp sbp smoke educ ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 18.3 15.4 47.2 2.78 29.5 49.7 1 D ## 2 2 19.4 14.5 52.1 3.47 31.3 49.0 2 C ## 3 3 21.1 16.0 52.2 4.06 32.4 51.7 1 B ## 4 4 21.3 19.5 53.2 4.48 32.0 NA 2 A ## 5 5 21.1 18.6 55.4 5.34 33.7 53.8 1 D ## 6 6 23.9 19.5 54.3 6.29 35.0 56.0 2 C tail(bmi) # last six rows ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## id age bmi chol insulin dbp sbp smoke educ ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 15 34.8 30.4 63.6 15.3 42.7 64.8 1 B ## 2 16 33.6 29.9 65.5 NA 46.4 65.6 2 A ## 3 17 33.4 NA 65.2 18.2 46.2 64.6 1 D ## 4 18 35.1 32.5 68.6 19.7 45.8 66.1 2 C ## 5 19 35.0 33.4 NA 21.1 NA 68.4 1 B ## 6 20 37.5 34.1 68.0 22.1 49.3 68.6 2 A If you want to see more on what the data looks like the following functions can help. nrow(bmi) # how many rows in dataset ## [1] 20 ncol(bmi) # how many columns in dataset ## [1] 9 colnames(bmi) # column names ## [1] &quot;id&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;bmi&quot; &quot;chol&quot; &quot;insulin&quot; &quot;dbp&quot; &quot;sbp&quot; ## [8] &quot;smoke&quot; &quot;educ&quot; If you just want to view your entire dataset, there is a function for that. View(bmi) You can also see the struture of your data, whether each variable is a number, character, factor, etc. This will become extremely important when trying to graph and analysis different types of data. str(bmi) ## tibble [20 x 9] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ id : num [1:20] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ age : num [1:20] 18.3 19.4 21.1 21.3 21.1 ... ## $ bmi : num [1:20] 15.4 14.5 16 19.5 18.6 ... ## $ chol : num [1:20] 47.2 52.1 52.2 53.2 55.4 ... ## $ insulin: num [1:20] 2.78 3.47 4.06 4.48 5.34 ... ## $ dbp : num [1:20] 29.5 31.3 32.4 32 33.7 ... ## $ sbp : num [1:20] 49.7 49 51.7 NA 53.8 ... ## $ smoke : num [1:20] 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ... ## $ educ : chr [1:20] &quot;D&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;A&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;spec&quot;)= ## .. cols( ## .. id = col_double(), ## .. age = col_double(), ## .. bmi = col_double(), ## .. chol = col_double(), ## .. insulin = col_double(), ## .. dbp = col_double(), ## .. sbp = col_double(), ## .. smoke = col_double(), ## .. educ = col_character() ## .. ) Here you can see that all variables are numeric, except for education with is a character. If you need to change the struture of a variable say to a factor to group data in a certain way you would do the following: bmi$smoke &lt;- as.factor(bmi$smoke) The $ basically allows you to call certain columns in a datframe. The code bmi$smoke is allowing us to only change that column, or variable to a factor without changing anything else in the dataframe. You can also change variables to characters with as.character() and to numbers with as.number(). 2.6 The RStudio Environment RStudio Environment You Rstudio enviornment is separated into 4 main panes. On your machine these panes by be organized differently. You can also change the order of these panes by going your tools tab, then clicking Global preferences. First, in the top left, you have a source pane - or script. This is where you will be writing most of your code. You will have to run the code, before seeing the output in the console. These pane is important because this is where you can write and save code for future use. Second, on the bottom left, there is the Console. All of the script’s output will be assess and found in the console. However, objects in the console will not be saved. You can also, type right in the console for fast calculations, like this: 4+5 ## [1] 9 Third, you have a Gobal Environment and History in the top right. Your gobal environment will display all the names of objects you defined in your script. Here is an example of a Gobal Environment where you can see dataframes, matrices, values, and functions: Global Environment If you click the play arrow next to the dataframe, you can view the entire dataframe. This is the save as running the function View(df). Another, important button is the broom icon, if you click this it will clear your gobal enviornment and you will have to rerun code to get any dataframes, function, etc. back. In the History tab, you can see all the code that was once ran through your console. This tab can be important, because as I said before information in the console is never saved and can be deleted easily. Nevertheless, you should get use to saving your code in R scripts, so you will probably not use this tab to often. The fourth pane, is the most compacted and has tabs for files, plots, packages, and help. The file tab, allows you access all files on your hard drive. The Plot tab, will be filled with plots generated from your code. There are puttons right under the tab to Zoom and Export plots. There is also a button which looks like a broom, this will clear the plots. The Packages tab, has a User Library which is just a list of all the packages you already have install on your machine. You can also install a package, by hitting the install button and then search for your wanted package. The update button will update all packages you already have installed. The Help tab, will give you information to help understand different functions and commands in R. You can also call for help with a function right from the console like this: ?t.test ## starting httpd help server ... done 2.7 The Command Prompt There are several ways to run the code in your script file. You can highlight your code, then hit ‘Run’ in the top right corner of the script file. You can click anywhere on the code, then hit ‘Run’ You can highlight or click on the code you want to run, then use the keyboard shortcut with is “Command + Return” on Mac, or “Control + Enter” on PC 2.8 What is an RScript File? console vs script. what a # does in a script …. Saving Scripts etc. 2.9 What are Packages include the code they should run at the beginning of this course to have all packages installed. 2.10 Project Folders and Working Directories how projects and folders are managed. 2.11 Where to Get Help for R stuff help guides…. how can you use them.? ? stackoverflow rstudio cheatsheets navarro textbook wilke textbook our guidebook 2.12 Quitting R how to quit from R successful, you don’t have to hit that save object thing all the time….
