Curley &amp; Tyler M. Milewski June 28, 2020 1 Welcome to PSY317! The following is a simple guide to R studio. What this guide contains.... That it's mainly a how to implement stuff in R, but it also touches on bits of stats and data theory where applicable 1.1 What this book includes and what it doesn't This is in between a textbook and a study guide. We're trying to build materials that will enable students to quickly find what they're looking for to help them understand these statistical concepts. This book is primarily aimed at the content in PSY317L (and PSY1XXR), but occasionally we describe concepts that we don't directly cover in these courses. This is when we feel that it's worth explaining things in a bit more detail for those students that want to know a bit more about a subject. 1.2 Acknowledgements This guidebook is built upon the work of several others' teaching materials. In particular, Danielle Navarro's book.... also some examples come from Andy Field's intro to statistics using R 1.3 References The following books are all freely avaiable online (like this one!) and are helpful resources wilke - visualizing wickham grolemund - intro R other wickham books? danielle navarro - intro stats 1.4 Other places to find help about R Rstudio - cheatsheets, community pages ??? 1.5 Other places to find help about R and Statistics With statistics stuff, you can never really have enough resources. Although throughout this course we try to explain difficult concepts in terms we hope all students can understand, sometimes you just need to read or hear about these concepts several times before they sink in. Othertimes, it's not until somebody else explains it in a slightly different way that it finally finds a home in your brain. To that end, we recommend looking over some other help tutorials and reading. You certainly don't have to go looking at these materials - but if you feel like hearing a different voice, then these are some that I recommend. Albert Kim stuff? Andrew Field's statistics in R book - probably the next level up from introduction in terms of R. Khan Academy videos.(not on R though) "],

The initial steps are downloading and installing R. This may differ slightly based on your machine. 2.2 Downloading R Go to the R website. The first box has options for downloading R for Mac, Windows or Linux. Click on the appropriate link. Then you will want to click on \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{&quot;install R for the first time&quot;}}\\). Then follow the instructions. 2.3 Downloading RStudio blah blah blah 2.4 Using RCloud instead of RStudio blah blah blah 2.5 Importing Data There are different options for importing data. It's possible to import data of all different formats into RStudio. We will primarily use spreadsheet type files that have been saved with the &quot;.csv&quot; suffix. These are called 'comma separated files'. Option 1. Import Tab You can click on the &quot;Import Dataset&quot; tab in the top right of RStudio - it's located just above your global environment. Tyler - perhaps we can insert images here? like this Of course, we should look into how to chaneg image sizes. You then need to click on the appropriate file type that you wish to import. As I mentioned, nearly all our files will be &quot;.csv&quot; files, so you should click on &quot;From CSV&quot;. In other versions of RStudio, this may say &quot;from text (readR)&quot; instead. blah blah blah I can't remember how to insert more space between sections, so I just write to try and force space. Option 2. Writing code. This is the option that we will use in our scripts for this course. You may notice that all the datasets that we wish to use are in a folder called &quot;data&quot;. To read in any of these datasets, what we need to do is use the read_csv() function. This comes from a package contained with the tidyverse package, so we must have imported that library first. We then tell it which dataset to find within the 'data' folder. We use the notation &quot;data/...&quot; to tell it to look inside the data folder. For instance, if we wished to load in the bmi.csv dataset, and assign it the name bmi, we would do it like this - make sure to put quotes around the whole file name and location: library(tidyverse) #load package ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 -- ## v ggplot2 3.2.1 v purrr 0.2.4 ## v tibble 2.1.3 v dplyr 0.8.3 ## v tidyr 1.0.2 v stringr 1.3.1 ## v readr 1.1.1 v forcats 0.3.0 ## Warning: package &#39;ggplot2&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## Warning: package &#39;tibble&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## Warning: package &#39;tidyr&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## Warning: package &#39;dplyr&#39; was built under R version 3.5.3 ## -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() -- ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() bmi &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/bmi.csv&quot;) # bring in data ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## id = col_integer(), ## age = col_double(), ## bmi = col_double(), ## chol = col_double(), ## insulin = col_double(), ## dbp = col_double(), ## sbp = col_double(), ## smoke = col_integer(), ## educ = col_character() ## ) head(bmi) # first six rows ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## id age bmi chol insulin dbp sbp smoke educ ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 18.3 15.4 47.2 2.78 29.5 49.7 1 D ## 2 2 19.4 14.5 52.1 3.47 31.3 49.0 2 C ## 3 3 21.1 16.0 52.2 4.06 32.4 51.7 1 B ## 4 4 21.3 19.5 53.2 4.48 32.0 NA 2 A ## 5 5 21.1 18.6 55.4 5.34 33.7 53.8 1 D ## 6 6 23.9 19.5 54.3 6.29 35.0 56.0 2 C Tyler.....Perhaps we should either suppress the warnings and messages (which you can do in the r chunk header in markdown)?

["basic-syntax.html", "3 Basic Syntax 3.1 boring mathematical stuff 3.2 assignment 3.3 vectors", " 3 Basic Syntax We kind of need to know at least a tiny bit of syntax before we move forward... keep it very simple. 3.1 boring mathematical stuff R is, first and foremost, a statistical programming language. So, unsurprisingly, you can do a bunch of mathematical operations fairly easily. Let's do some really tedious math: You can add with the + key: 4 + 6 ## [1] 10 You can see that the output returned 10 indicating that that is the answer to 4 + 6. However, we also see in the output a [1] before it. What does this mean? This is an index - which we'll talk about in more detail later- but essentially all it is telling us is that the number that comes directly after it is the first bit of the output. We only have one thing in our output here - the number 10, so it's pretty pointless - but it does have relevance in the future. For now though, you can safely ignore it. Subtracting uses a hyphen or minus key -: 43 - 18 ## [1] 25 Multiplying uses the asterisk *: 5 * 3 ## [1] 15 Dividing uses this slash key /: 34 / 7 ## [1] 4.857143 You can square root like so by typing sqrt() and putting your number to square root in the brackets: sqrt(45) ## [1] 6.708204 Squaring a number requires us to use the cute ^ key followed by a number 2 to indicate that we are raising to the power 2 (which is squaring): 12^2 ## [1] 144 Our first little warning Like all programming languages, R will only do what it's told. One thing that catches people out is that it will read code in order from left to right. So, if you're doing several things at once, you may need to insert brackets to make sure that it does what you want it to. For instance, say you want to multiply 5 by the sum of 7 and 9. You might write that like this: 5 * 7 + 9 ## [1] 44 but 44 is not the answer you're looking for! What it has done is to take 5, then multiply it by 7 (makes 35) and then add 9 to make 44. OK, how about you write it like this instead: 7 + 9 * 5 ## [1] 52 Erm, this time it multiplied 9 by 5 to get 45 and then added 7 to make 52. What is happening is that some mathematical operations are taking precedence over others and R does things in certain order. To explicitly make sure that it does what you want, insert some brackets like this: 5 * (7 + 9) ## [1] 80 Now it knows that what you wanted to do was to add 7 and 9 to get 16 and have that number multiplied by 5 to get 80. This sort of thing is something to look out for, but as you get experienced you'll have a sense for it. Well placed brackets can save you a headache. 3.2 assignment e.g. what the assignment operator is. This symbol &lt;- which is just a &quot;greater than sign&quot; followed by a &quot;hyphen&quot; is called an assignment operator. It basically is equivalent to saying you want to save something. You write what you want to be saved on the right hand side of it, and the name of your newly saved thing on the left of it. We call the 'thing' that you've saved an 'object' in programming speak. For instance, say you wanted to save the number 17, and you wanted to call that saved number an object called x. You'd do it like this: x &lt;- 17 Now, whenever you type, x, R thinks that it is the number 17. x ## [1] 17 We should probably fess up right now and tell you that there is another way that you can assign things in R. On the face of it, it's a much easier way too, but we're going to recommend you don't do it. The only reason that we're bringing it up at this point is that if you look up help on the internet or in some books, you'll see people doing it - so we should mention it. You can assign using the equal key = like this: y = 10 - 2 y ## [1] 8 So, as you can see, we created an object called y that was equal to 10 minus 2, that is 8. Using = seems so much easier than using &lt;- so what is the reason not to do it? Well, the equal sign gets used for a ton of other commands and sometimes it gets a little messy and confusing if too many equal signs fly around. Thefore, we're going to politely ask that whenever you assign things, please use the &lt;- operator, even though it's two bits of punctuation stuck together: hooray &lt;- 17 + 4 # thanks for using this sign hooray ## [1] 21 3.3 vectors Of course, you can save even more complex things as the object. For example, if you wished to save the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, you have two ways of doing that. Let's just see them in action, and then we'll explain the syntax: v1 &lt;- 5:10 v1 ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 v2 &lt;- c(5,6,7,8,9,10) v2 ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 As you can see both v1 and v2 are our newly saved objects and they both contain the numbers 5 through 10. For v1 we separated the numbers 5 and 10 with a colon :. In R, the : sign can be used to mean &quot;to&quot; when talking about a series of numbers. e.g. 5:10 ## [1] 5 6 7 8 9 10 101:103 ## [1] 101 102 103 The other way we did it with v2 was to use the c() function. This stands for concatenate which is a mouthful. Basically, it's a way of sticking things together. You write c() and then put the stuff you want to stick together inside the brackets, but make sure you separate each thing by a comma ,. For example, c(1,10,100,1000) ## [1] 1 10 100 1000 c(4,6,8,10,8,6,1) ## [1] 4 6 8 10 8 6 1 Another bit of terminology might be worth mentioning right now. Our saved objects x, v1 and v2, as well as being called objects can also be called vectors. A vector is something in R that contains several items. These items are actually called elements. Importantly the items are indexed, which means that they are in order, not all jumbled up. That means that you can directly grab an element by it's position. So, if you wished to get the first element (or item) of the object v1 you'd type like this: v1[1] ## [1] 5 That returns '5' which was our first element we put into the vector. If we wish to get the 3rd element of v1 we'd do this: v1[3] ## [1] 7 And, if we wished to get the first, second and third element of v1 we'd do this: v1[1:3] ## [1] 5 6 7 blah blah blah summary image does the image appear above? I just remembered that if you don't want the image to appear inline, then you leave out the ! from the markdown syntax. summary image Now, one of the great advantages of vectors is that you can do things to all of the numbers inside the vectors at once. For instance, say we wanted to square all the numbers inside of v1, then all we need to do is: v1^2 ## [1] 25 36 49 64 81 100 and notice how it squared the numbers 5 through 10 that are the contents of v1. You can also do things to the entire contents of a vector at once. For instance, if you wanted to add up all the numbers in v1 you could do this by using the function sum() like this: sum(v1) ## [1] 45 and it added 5+6+7+8+9+10 to give one answer! "],

All of these packages work together to manipulate, reshape, and visual data. Before using tidyverse you will need to install and load the package.

The trendline is to help demonstrate how correlations of different magnitudes look in terms of their association. Correlations 10.2 Calculating the Pearson Correlation in R To calculate the correlation coefficient in R, it's pretty straightforward. You simply can use the cor() function. For instance, let's correlate... cor(1:10,1:10) # replace with an example ## [1] 1 Before we go further into what we should do with these correlations, and how to signficance test them, let's learn a little bit more about how they come about. 10.3 Cross-products The formula for calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient for a sample is: \\(r = \\frac{\\sum_{}^{} z_{x}z_{y}}{n - 1}\\) When we have a population, we can use the formula: \\(r = \\frac{\\sum_{}^{} z_{x}z_{y}}{N}\\) Essentially, the steps are to convert all the X and Y scores into their respective z-scores. Then you mutliply these two values together to get the cross-product. After summing up all the cross-products for each data point, we divide this number by n-1 if we're dealing with a sample (we usually are), or N if we're dealing with a population. The sum of the cross-products will therefore be largely positive if positive z-scores are multiple together or if negative z-scores are multiplied together. The sum of the cross-products will be largely negative if negative z-scores are multipled with positive z-scores. The following example should help make this clearer. Look at the following data, its scatterplot and the correlation coefficient. They show that we have a positive correlation of r=0.84. Let's break it down how we got that value. x &lt;- c(1.1, 1.5, 2.1, 3.5, 3.6, 3.5, 2.6, 5.6, 4.4, 3.9) y &lt;- c(2.8, 2.9, 1.6, 5.5, 4.7, 8.1, 3.3, 7.7, 7.1, 5.8) df &lt;- data.frame(x, y) df ## x y ## 1 1.1 2.8 ## 2 1.5 2.9 ## 3 2.1 1.6 ## 4 3.5 5.5 ## 5 3.6 4.7 ## 6 3.5 8.1 ## 7 2.6 3.3 ## 8 5.6 7.7 ## 9 4.4 7.1 ## 10 3.9 5.8 ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(size=2) cor(x,y) ## [1] 0.8418262 First, let's calculate the means and standard deviation (using sd so a sample standard deviation) of x and y. We need to get these values so we can calculate the z-scores of each. # step 1: Get the mean and sd of x and y mean(x) ## [1] 3.18 sd(x) ## [1] 1.370158 mean(y) ## [1] 4.95 sd(y) ## [1] 2.259916 Now, we can calculate the z-scores, remembering that the formula for that is: \\(z = \\frac{x - \\overline{x}}{s_{x}}\\) # step 2. Calculate z-scores of x, and z-scores of y. df$zx &lt;- (x - mean(x)) / sd(x) # z scores of x df$zy &lt;- (y - mean(y)) / sd(y) # z scores of y df ## x y zx zy ## 1 1.1 2.8 -1.5180729 -0.9513626 ## 2 1.5 2.9 -1.2261358 -0.9071132 ## 3 2.1 1.6 -0.7882302 -1.4823557 ## 4 3.5 5.5 0.2335497 0.2433718 ## 5 3.6 4.7 0.3065340 -0.1106236 ## 6 3.5 8.1 0.2335497 1.3938569 ## 7 2.6 3.3 -0.4233088 -0.7301155 ## 8 5.6 7.7 1.7662195 1.2168592 ## 9 4.4 7.1 0.8904082 0.9513626 ## 10 3.9 5.8 0.5254868 0.3761201 Following this, we simply multiple the z-scores of x and y against each other for every data point: # step 3. Calculate the cross-product: zx * zy df$zxzy &lt;- df$zx * df$zy df ## x y zx zy zxzy ## 1 1.1 2.8 -1.5180729 -0.9513626 1.44423785 ## 2 1.5 2.9 -1.2261358 -0.9071132 1.11224399 ## 3 2.1 1.6 -0.7882302 -1.4823557 1.16843751 ## 4 3.5 5.5 0.2335497 0.2433718 0.05683941 ## 5 3.6 4.7 0.3065340 -0.1106236 -0.03390988 ## 6 3.5 8.1 0.2335497 1.3938569 0.32553483 ## 7 2.6 3.3 -0.4233088 -0.7301155 0.30906432 ## 8 5.6 7.7 1.7662195 1.2168592 2.14924036 ## 9 4.4 7.1 0.8904082 0.9513626 0.84710104 ## 10 3.9 5.8 0.5254868 0.3761201 0.19764615 We now have all of our cross-products. Notice why the majority are positive. This is because we have multiplied positive \\(z_{x}\\) with positive \\(z_{y}\\) or we multiplied negative \\(z_{x}\\) with negative \\(z_{y}\\). This happens because datapoints that tend to be above the mean for x are also above the mean for y, and points that are below the mean of x are also below the mean of y. We can add this up to get the sum of the cross-products. That is the \\(\\sum_{}^{} z_{x}z_{y}\\) in the formula. # step 4. Sum up the cross products. sum(df$zxzy) # 7.58 ## [1] 7.576436 We now divide that by n-1 as we have a sample, to get the correlation coefficient r. That gives us an estimation of the average cross-product. # step 5- calculate &#39;r&#39; by dividing by n-1. (for a sample) sum(df$zxzy) / 9 # our n was 10, so n-1 = 9 ## [1] 0.8418262 sum(df$zxzy) / (nrow(df) - 1) # nrow(df) is more generalizable ## [1] 0.8418262 # r=0.84 Just as a quick second example, here is a work through calculating a negative correlation. Notice the \\(z_{x}\\) and \\(z_{y}\\) scores that are multiplied together. They are largely opposite in terms of signs. This is what leads to a negative sum of cross-products and the negative correlation. Why? Because data points that are above the mean for x are generally below the mean in terms of y and visa-versa. ### Example 2.

Let's use some BlueJay data to do this. We'll just use data on male birds. library(tidyverse) jays &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/BlueJays.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## BirdID = col_character(), ## KnownSex = col_character(), ## BillDepth = col_double(), ## BillWidth = col_double(), ## BillLength = col_double(), ## Head = col_double(), ## Mass = col_double(), ## Skull = col_double(), ## Sex = col_integer() ## ) jayM &lt;- jays %&gt;% filter(KnownSex == &quot;M&quot;) # we&#39;ll just look at Males nrow(jayM) # 63 observations ## [1] 63 head(jayM) ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## BirdID KnownSex BillDepth BillWidth BillLength Head Mass Skull Sex ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 0000-00000 M 8.26 9.21 25.9 56.6 73.3 30.7 1 ## 2 1142-05901 M 8.54 8.76 25.0 56.4 75.1 31.4 1 ## 3 1142-05905 M 8.39 8.78 26.1 57.3 70.2 31.2 1 ## 4 1142-05909 M 8.71 9.84 25.5 57.3 74.9 31.8 1 ## 5 1142-05912 M 8.74 9.28 25.4 57.1 75.1 31.8 1 ## 6 1142-05914 M 8.72 9.94 30 60.7 78.1 30.7 1 Let's say you're interested in examining whether there is an association between Body Mass and Head Size. First we'll make a scatterplot between the Mass and Head columns. We'll also investigate the correlation using cor(). ggplot(jayM, aes(x=Mass, y=Head)) + geom_point(shape = 21, colour = &quot;navy&quot;, fill = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;) + stat_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, se=F) cor(jayM$Mass, jayM$Head) # r = 0.58, a strong positive correlation. ## [1] 0.5773562 To run the significance test, we do the following: cor.test(jayM$Head, jayM$Mass) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: jayM$Head and jayM$Mass ## t = 5.5228, df = 61, p-value = 7.282e-07 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.3846090 0.7218601 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5773562 This gives us a lot of information. Firstly, at the bottom it repeats the correlation coefficient cor. At the top, it gives us the value of t which is essentially how surprising it is for us to get the correlation we did assuming we were drawing our sample from a population where there is no correlation. Associated with this t value is the degrees of freedom which is equal to n-2, so in this case that is 63-2 = 61. The p-value is also given. If we are using alpha=0.05 as our significance level, then we can reject the hypothesis that there is no overall correlation in the population between Body Mass and Head size if p&lt;0.05. The default for cor.test() is to do a two-tailed test. This is testing whether your observed correlation r is different from r=0 in either the positive or negative direction. This default version also gives us the confidence interval for the correlation coefficient. Essentially, this gives us the interval in which we have a 95% confidence that the true population r lies (remember we just have data from one sample that theoretically comes from a population). It's also possible however that you had an a priori prediction about the direction of the effect. For instance, you may have predicted that Body Mass would be positively correlated with Head Size. In this case, you could do a one-tailed correlation test, where your alternative hypothesis is that there is a positive correlation and the null is that the correlation coefficient is equal to 0 or less than 0. To do one-tailed tests you need to add the alternative argument. # testing if there is a positive correlation cor.test(jayM$Head, jayM$Mass, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: jayM$Head and jayM$Mass ## t = 5.5228, df = 61, p-value = 3.641e-07 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is greater than 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4187194 1.0000000 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5773562 # testing if there is a negative correlation cor.test(jayM$Head, jayM$Mass, alternative = &quot;less&quot;) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: jayM$Head and jayM$Mass ## t = 5.5228, df = 61, p-value = 1 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is less than 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -1.0000000 0.7017994 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5773562 10.5 Assumptions of Pearson's Correlation The Pearson Correlation Coefficient requires your data to be approximately normally distributed. To do this we have various options how to test for normality. Firstly, we could do a Shapiro-Wilk test, which formally determines whether our data are normal. This is done using shapiro.test(), where we assume our data are from a normal population if the resulting p-value is above 0.05. If the p-value is below 0.05 then we have evidence to reject that our data come from a normal population. With our data above, this would look like this when running the test on each variable: shapiro.test(jayM$Mass) # P &gt; 0.05, therefore cannot reject null that data is not normal ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: jayM$Mass ## W = 0.97222, p-value = 0.1647 shapiro.test(jayM$Head) # P &gt; 0.05, therefore cannot reject null that data is not normal ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: jayM$Head ## W = 0.96521, p-value = 0.07189 We can also make a QQ-plot for each variable. Essentially what we require from this plot is for the majority of our data to fall on the straight line - especially the datapoints in the middle. Some deviation at the tails is ok. This plot orders our data and plots the observed data against values on the x-axis that we would expect to get if our data was truly from a normal population. qqnorm(jayM$Mass) qqline(jayM$Mass, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) qqnorm(jayM$Head) qqline(jayM$Head, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) Both of these QQ plots are ok, and indicate normality, as does our Shapiro-Wilk tests. Therefore we would be ok to use a Pearson Correlation test with these data. What should you do though if either of your continuous variables are not approximately normally distributed? In that case, there are other correlation coefficients and associated significance tests that you could run instead. We describe these in more detail in Section x.xxx 10.6 Confidence Intervals for R bit more on this and the theory. 10.7 Partial Correlations why.... the stupid formula.... and how to do in R.... and that there are technically better ways... 10.8 Non-parametric Correlations examples.... when I can be bothered, edit this code chunk down into words + code When at least on of our variables are not normal, then we need to consider alternative approaches to the Pearson correlation for assessing correlations. Let's take this example, where we are interested in seeing if there's an association between saturated fat and cholesterol levels across a bunch of different cheeses: library(tidyverse) cheese &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/cheese.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## type = col_character(), ## sat_fat = col_double(), ## polysat_fat = col_double(), ## monosat_fat = col_double(), ## protein = col_double(), ## carb = col_double(), ## chol = col_integer(), ## fiber = col_double(), ## kcal = col_integer() ## ) head(cheese) ## # A tibble: 6 x 9 ## type sat_fat polysat_fat monosat_fat protein carb chol fiber kcal ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 blue 18.7 0.8 7.78 21.4 2.34 75 0 353 ## 2 brick 18.8 0.784 8.60 23.2 2.79 94 0 371 ## 3 brie 17.4 0.826 8.01 20.8 0.45 100 0 334 ## 4 camembert 15.3 0.724 7.02 19.8 0.46 72 0 300 ## 5 caraway 18.6 0.83 8.28 25.2 3.06 93 0 376 ## 6 cheddar 21.1 0.942 9.39 24.9 1.28 105 0 403 # let&#39;s make a scatterplot of saturated fat against cholesterol ggplot(cheese, aes(x = sat_fat, y = chol)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,se=F) It looks like there is a pretty obvious relationship, but let's check the normality of each variable before progressing. Firstly the Shapiro-Wilk tests suggest that our data do not come from a normal distribution: shapiro.test(cheese$sat_fat) # P &lt; 0.05, therefore data may not be normal ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: cheese$sat_fat ## W = 0.85494, p-value = 6.28e-07 shapiro.test(cheese$chol) # P &lt; 0.05, therefore data may not be normal ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: cheese$chol ## W = 0.90099, p-value = 2.985e-05 Secondly, we have quite dramatic deviation from the straight line of our datapoints in our QQ plots. This indicates that our dat are likley skewed. qqnorm(cheese$sat_fat) qqline(cheese$sat_fat, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) qqnorm(cheese$chol) qqline(cheese$chol, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) We could be thorough and check this by plotting histograms of our data: library(gridExtra) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;gridExtra&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:dplyr&#39;: ## ## combine p1 &lt;- ggplot(cheese, aes(x=sat_fat)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;lightseagreen&quot;) p2 &lt;- ggplot(cheese, aes(x=chol)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;lightseagreen&quot;) grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Because our data do not appear to be normal, we cannot do a Pearson correlation coefficient. We should instead use a non-parametric correlation method. There are several of these to choose from. We don't plan to go into the details here of how these methods determine their correlation coefficients or conduct significance test. In brief, these methods generally rank order the datapoints along the x and y axes and then determine how ordered these ranks are with respect to each other. Probably the most commonly used non-parametric correlation test is called the Spearman Rank Correlation test. To run this, we can use cor() to get the correlation or cor.test() to run the signficance test in the same way we did the Pearson test. However, the difference here is that we specify method=&quot;spearman&quot; at the end. cor(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;spearman&quot;) ## [1] 0.8677042 cor.test(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;spearman&quot;) ## Warning in cor.test.default(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;spearman&quot;): ## Cannot compute exact p-value with ties ## ## Spearman&#39;s rank correlation rho ## ## data: cheese$sat_fat and cheese$chol ## S = 8575.9, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true rho is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## rho ## 0.8677042 The correlation coefficient here is 0.87 and is termed rho instead of r. With the significance test, you get a test-statistic S which relates to how well ordered the ranked data are. Also provided is a p-value. As with the Pearson, the default is a 2-tailed test, testing whether the obsvered correlation could have come from a population with a correlation of 0. If the p-value is below 0.05 (using alpha = 0.05 as our criterion), then that is reasonable evidence that there is a significant correlation. You may also notice with Spearman Rank correlations that you are forever getting warnings about computing p-values with ties. Don't worry at all about this - although this is an issue with the test and how it calculates the p-value, it isn't of any real practical concern. If you were interested in conducting a one-tailed correlation test, you could do that in the same way as you did for the Pearson. For instance, if you predicted that cholesterol and saturated fat would have a positive correlation, you could do the following to do a one-tailed test: cor.test(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;spearman&quot;, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) ## Warning in cor.test.default(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;spearman&quot;, : ## Cannot compute exact p-value with ties ## ## Spearman&#39;s rank correlation rho ## ## data: cheese$sat_fat and cheese$chol ## S = 8575.9, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true rho is greater than 0 ## sample estimates: ## rho ## 0.8677042 You may also notice that the output of the Spearman Rank test does not give confidence intervals for the value of rho. This is unfortunate and is one of the drawbacks of doing a non-parametric correlation. Finally, there are several other types of non-parametric correlations you could choose from if you didn't want to do a Spearman Rank correlation. We personally recommend using a method called Kendalls Tau B correlation, which can be done like this: cor.test(cheese$sat_fat, cheese$chol, method = &quot;kendall&quot;) ## ## Kendall&#39;s rank correlation tau ## ## data: cheese$sat_fat and cheese$chol ## z = 8.8085, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true tau is not equal to 0 ## sample estimates: ## tau ## 0.7102531 This output gives you a tau value which is the correlation coefficient, and a p-value which you can interpret in the same way as the other tests. Ranked Data If at least one of your variables of your data are rank (ordinal) data, then you should use non-parametric correlations. In the following example, the data show the dominance rank, age, body size and testosterone levels for a group of 18 animals. Lower numbers of the ranks, indicate a higher ranking animal. An animal with rank 1 means that it is the most dominant individual. Perhaps with such data you may be interested in seeing if there was an association between dominance rank and testosterone levels. Because your dominance rank measure is ordinal (a rank), then you should pick a non-parametric correlation. test &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/testosterone.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## drank = col_integer(), ## age = col_double(), ## size = col_integer(), ## testosterone = col_double() ## ) head(test) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## drank age size testosterone ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 3 13 183 4.8 ## 2 7 9 155 3.9 ## 3 7 5.5 144 3.8 ## 4 1 11.5 201 6.4 ## 5 12 3.5 125 1.8 ## 6 4 10 166 4.3 ggplot(test, aes(x = drank, y = testosterone)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se=F) + xlab(&quot;Dominance Rank&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Testosterone Level&quot;) cor(test$drank, test$testosterone, method = &quot;spearman&quot;) # rho = -0.91 ## [1] -0.9083378 If you had the a priori prediction, that more dominant animals would have higher testosterone, then you could do a one-tailed test. This would mean that you expect there to be a negative correlation - as the rank number gets higher, the levels of testosterone would fall. In this case, you'd use alternative = &quot;less&quot;. cor.test(test$drank, test$testosterone, method = &quot;spearman&quot;, alternative = &quot;less&quot;) # 1- tailed ## Warning in cor.test.default(test$drank, test$testosterone, method = ## &quot;spearman&quot;, : Cannot compute exact p-value with ties ## ## Spearman&#39;s rank correlation rho ## ## data: test$drank and test$testosterone ## S = 1849.2, p-value = 9.367e-08 ## alternative hypothesis: true rho is less than 0 ## sample estimates: ## rho ## -0.9083378 10.9 Point-Biserial Correlation why, what....

["permutation-testing.html", "12 Permutation Testing 12.1 t-test Permutation 12.2 Correlation Coefficient Permutation Tests", " 12 Permutation Testing An example of permutation testing and the theory behind it. 12.1 t-test Permutation Let's look at our two independent samples of exam scores: library(tidyverse) anastasia &lt;- c(65, 74, 73, 83, 76, 65, 86, 70, 80, 55, 78, 78, 90, 77, 68) bernadette &lt;- c(72, 66, 71, 66, 76, 69, 79, 73, 62, 69, 68, 60, 73, 68, 67, 74, 56, 74) # put into a dataframe: dd &lt;- data.frame(values = c(anastasia, bernadette), group = c(rep(&quot;Anastasia&quot;,15), rep(&quot;Bernadette&quot;, 18)) ) dd ## values group ## 1 65 Anastasia ## 2 74 Anastasia ## 3 73 Anastasia ## 4 83 Anastasia ## 5 76 Anastasia ## 6 65 Anastasia ## 7 86 Anastasia ## 8 70 Anastasia ## 9 80 Anastasia ## 10 55 Anastasia ## 11 78 Anastasia ## 12 78 Anastasia ## 13 90 Anastasia ## 14 77 Anastasia ## 15 68 Anastasia ## 16 72 Bernadette ## 17 66 Bernadette ## 18 71 Bernadette ## 19 66 Bernadette ## 20 76 Bernadette ## 21 69 Bernadette ## 22 79 Bernadette ## 23 73 Bernadette ## 24 62 Bernadette ## 25 69 Bernadette ## 26 68 Bernadette ## 27 60 Bernadette ## 28 73 Bernadette ## 29 68 Bernadette ## 30 67 Bernadette ## 31 74 Bernadette ## 32 56 Bernadette ## 33 74 Bernadette We can plot these data as boxplots to get a sense of the within group variation as well as the observed differences between the groups: ggplot(dd, aes(x = group, y = values, fill = group)) + geom_boxplot(alpha=.3, outlier.shape = NA) + geom_jitter(width=.1, size=2) + theme_classic() + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;firebrick&quot;, &quot;dodgerblue&quot;)) Now, from our two independent samples, we can directly observe what the difference in sample means is. This is just calculated by subtracting one sample mean from the other: meandif &lt;- mean(anastasia) - mean(bernadette) # 5.48 meandif ## [1] 5.477778 So, from our samples, we observed a difference in grades of 5.48 between the groups. Typically, we would run an independent t-test to test whether these two samples came from theoretical populations that differ in their means: t.test(anastasia, bernadette, var.equal = T) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: anastasia and bernadette ## t = 2.1154, df = 31, p-value = 0.04253 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.1965873 10.7589683 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 74.53333 69.05556 This Student's t-test (notice var.equal=T) suggests that this is a significant difference, meaning that the groups do differ in their population means. However, this test relies on several assumptions (see section xx.x.x). Instead, we could apply a permutation test that is free of assumptions. Essentially what we are going to do is ask how surprising it was to get a difference of 5.48 given our real data. Put another way, if we shuffled the data into different groups of 15 and 18 (the respective sample sizes of Anastasia and Bernadette), would we get a difference in sample means of greater or lower than 5.48? If we did this thousands of times, how many times would we get differences in sample means above 5.48? Let's apply this theory to just one permutation. First, we combine all the data: set.seed(1) # just to keep the random number generator the same for all of us allscores &lt;- c(anastasia, bernadette) allscores ## [1] 65 74 73 83 76 65 86 70 80 55 78 78 90 77 68 72 66 71 66 76 69 79 73 62 69 ## [26] 68 60 73 68 67 74 56 74 Next, we shuffle them into new groups of 15 and 18.: x &lt;- split(sample(allscores), rep(1:2, c(15,18))) x ## $`1` ## [1] 80 78 71 73 65 68 67 74 72 74 76 83 68 70 69 ## ## $`2` ## [1] 74 90 69 68 78 66 73 76 62 56 79 65 60 73 55 77 66 86 We have two brand new samples that contain all of the scores from our original data, but they've just been shuffled around. We could look at what the difference in sample means is between these two new samples: x[[1]] # this is our shuffled sample of size 15 ## [1] 80 78 71 73 65 68 67 74 72 74 76 83 68 70 69 x[[2]] # this is our shuffled sample of size 18 ## [1] 74 90 69 68 78 66 73 76 62 56 79 65 60 73 55 77 66 86 mean(x[[1]]) # mean of the new sample of size 15 ## [1] 72.53333 mean(x[[2]]) # mean of the new sample of size 18 ## [1] 70.72222 # what&#39;s the difference in their means? mean(x[[1]]) - mean(x[[2]]) ## [1] 1.811111 The difference in sample means is 1.81, which is a lot smaller than our original difference in sample means. Let's do this same process 10,000 times! Don't worry too much about the details of the code. What we are doing is the above process, just putting it in a loop and asking it to do it 10,000 times. We save all the results in an object called results. results&lt;-vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ x &lt;- split(sample(allscores), rep(1:2, c(15,18))) results[[i]]&lt;-mean(x[[1]]) - mean(x[[2]]) } head(unlist(results)) # these are all our mean differences from 10,000 shuffles of the data. We&#39;re just looking at the first 6. ## [1] -1.8555556 -2.5888889 4.0111111 -3.9333333 0.2222222 3.5222222 We can actually make a histogram showing the distribution of these differences in sample means. df &lt;- data.frame(difs = unlist(results)) ggplot(df, aes(x=difs)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;green&quot;, alpha=.4) + geom_vline(color=&quot;navy&quot;,lwd=1,lty=2,xintercept = 5.48) + theme_classic()+ ggtitle(&quot;Mean Differences from \\n 10000 Permutations of Raw Data&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. This histogram shows that for some of our 10,000 shuffles, we actually got some differences between our two samples of higher than 5.48 (the dotted blue line), but the vast majority of shuffles led to samples that had mean differences lower than 5.48. In fact, several shuffles led to samples where the sample of size 18 (Bernadette in the original data) had a sample mean that was higher than the sample of size 15 (Anastasia in the original data). We can directly calculate how many times out of 10,000 shuffles we got a difference in sample means that was greater than 5.48 sum(unlist(results) &gt; 5.48) # 202 times out of 10000 ## [1] 215 To convert this to a p-value, we simply divide this value by the number of shuffles we ran - which was 10,000. sum(unlist(results) &gt; 5.48) /10000 # which is 0.0202 proportion of the time ## [1] 0.0215 So our p-value is p=0.0215 which is similar to a one-tailed p-value. 12.1.1 Example 2: Let's take a look at a second example. Here, we have various subjects rating their anxiety levels. They do this after either taking a new anxiolytic drug or a placebo. The subjects in each group are independent of each other. The placebo group has 19 subjects and the drug group has 21 subjects. The data: placebo &lt;- c(15, 16, 19, 19, 17, 20, 18, 14, 18, 20, 20, 20, 13, 11, 16, 19, 19, 16, 10) drug &lt;- c(15, 15, 16, 13, 11, 19, 17, 17, 11, 14, 10, 18, 19, 14, 13, 16, 16, 17, 14, 10, 14) length(placebo) #19 ## [1] 19 length(drug) #21 ## [1] 21 If we were interested in doing a Student's t-test, we might want to check whether the data are approximately normal. We could perform Shapiro-Wilk tests to do this: shapiro.test(drug) # approximately normal as p&gt;.05 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: drug ## W = 0.95184, p-value = 0.3688 shapiro.test(placebo) # not enough evidence to be normal as p&lt;.05 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: placebo ## W = 0.88372, p-value = 0.02494 From this we find that the placebo group is not approximately normally distributed (p value of the Shapiro-Wilk test is &lt;.05). We could do a non-parametric test such as Wilcoxon Ranked Sum test (see xxx.xxx), but an alternative strategy is to perform a permutation test. Let's first plot the data, and then look at our observed difference in anxiety scores between our two independent samples: # put into dataframe - long format df &lt;- data.frame(anxiety = c(placebo, drug), group = c(rep(&quot;placebo&quot;, length(placebo)), rep(&quot;drug&quot;, length(drug)) ) ) head(df) ## anxiety group ## 1 15 placebo ## 2 16 placebo ## 3 19 placebo ## 4 19 placebo ## 5 17 placebo ## 6 20 placebo #boxplots ggplot(df, aes(x=group, y=anxiety, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, alpha=.4) + geom_jitter(width=.1) + theme_classic() + scale_fill_manual(values=c(&quot;orange&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;)) mean(placebo) - mean(drug) #2.128 ## [1] 2.12782 So our observed difference in sample means is 2.128. In the permutation test, what we'll do is shuffle all the scores randomly between the two groups, creating new samples of the same size (19 and 21). Then we'll see what difference in sample means we get from those shuffled groups. We'll also do this 10,000 times. allvalues &lt;- c(placebo, drug) results&lt;-vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ x &lt;- split(sample(allvalues), rep(1:2, c(19,21))) results[[i]]&lt;-mean(x[[1]]) - mean(x[[2]]) } head(unlist(results)) # these are the first six of all our mean differences from 10,000 shuffles of the data. ## [1] -0.8796992 -0.7794486 -1.2807018 -0.4786967 2.5288221 1.1253133 Let's plot the distribution of these data to see what proportion of times our shuffled groups got samples that were greater than 2.128. df0 &lt;- data.frame(difs = unlist(results)) ggplot(df0, aes(x=difs)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;black&quot;, fill=&quot;pink&quot;, alpha=.4) + geom_vline(color=&quot;navy&quot;,lwd=1,lty=2,xintercept = 2.128) + theme_classic()+ ggtitle(&quot;Mean Differences from \\n 10000 Permutations of Raw Data&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. It looks like very few times did we get two samples that had differences in sample means that were greater than 2.128. We can calculate exactly how many times, and express this as the proportion of times we got a difference in sample means greater than 2.128: sum(unlist(results) &gt; 2.128) # 109 times out of 10000 ## [1] 113 sum(unlist(results) &gt; 2.128) /10000 # which is 0.0109 proportion of the time ## [1] 0.0113 So, in this case we can say that the probability of getting a difference in sample means between the drug and placebo groups that was larger than our observed difference of 2.128 was p = 0.0109. This is very strong evidence that the observed difference is significantly greater than we'd expect by chance. 12.2 Correlation Coefficient Permutation Tests You can apply the logic of permutation tests to almost any statistical test. Let's look at an example for Pearson correlations. In these data, we are looking at 15 subjects who are completing a task. We measured the time they spent on the task and their high scores. library(tidyverse) df &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/timescore.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## subject = col_character(), ## time = col_double(), ## score = col_double() ## ) head(df) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## subject time score ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1A 5.5 3 ## 2 2B 2.4 6.9 ## 3 3C 8.8 17.9 ## 4 4D 7 10.5 ## 5 5E 9.3 12.2 ## 6 6F 2.5 3.5 If we make a scatterplot of the data, we can see that those who spent longer on the task tended to get higher scores: # scatterplot ggplot(df, aes(x = time, y = score)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se=F) Using a standard approach, we could find the correlation of these two variables and run a signficance test using cor.test(). We can see that there is a moderate Pearson's r of r=0.55 which is statistically significant (p=0.031). # regular significance test cor.test(df$time,df$score) #r=0.55, p=0.031 ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: df$time and df$score ## t = 2.4258, df = 13, p-value = 0.03057 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.0643515 0.8324385 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5582129 We could take an alternative tack, and decide to do a permutation test. The idea here is again, how surprising is it to get a correlation of 0.55 with these data? Were there other ways of ordering the x and y variables to get higher correlation coefficients? Let's look at our y axis variable, the score: set.seed(1) # just doing this so all our results look same df$score # actual data in order ## [1] 3.0 6.9 17.9 10.5 12.2 3.5 11.0 7.6 8.4 13.4 10.1 9.0 10.1 17.7 6.8 This is the original order of the data. If we use sample() we can shuffle the data: sample(df$score) # actual data but order shuffled ## [1] 10.5 3.5 7.6 10.1 17.9 8.4 13.4 17.7 12.2 3.0 6.9 10.1 9.0 6.8 11.0 Let's shuffle the score again, but this time store it in the original dataframe: df$shuffle1 &lt;- sample(df$score) #create a new column with shuffled data df ## # A tibble: 15 x 4 ## subject time score shuffle1 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1A 5.5 3 7.6 ## 2 2B 2.4 6.9 10.1 ## 3 3C 8.8 17.9 10.1 ## 4 4D 7 10.5 12.2 ## 5 5E 9.3 12.2 8.4 ## 6 6F 2.5 3.5 13.4 ## 7 7G 4.8 11 6.9 ## 8 8H 4.1 7.6 3.5 ## 9 9I 5 8.4 3 ## 10 10J 2.9 13.4 17.7 ## 11 11K 6.4 10.1 6.8 ## 12 12L 7.7 9 11 ## 13 13M 9.3 10.1 9 ## 14 14N 8.3 17.7 17.9 ## 15 15O 5.1 6.8 10.5 If we plot this shuffled y (score) against the original x (time), we now get this scatterplot, which basically shows no relationship: # this is what that new column looks like: ggplot(df, aes(x = time, y = shuffle1)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se=F) And the correlation for this new scatterplot is really close to 0! r = 0.0005: cor.test(df$time, df$shuffle1) # now relationship is a bit negative ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: df$time and df$shuffle1 ## t = 0.0016429, df = 13, p-value = 0.9987 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.5119267 0.5125988 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.0004556502 We could shuffle the score variable even more times, and directly calculate the r value aginst the time variable for each shuffle using cor(). # we can do this many times cor(df$time, sample(df$score)) # r = 0.35 ## [1] 0.3023584 cor(df$time, sample(df$score)) # r = 0.04 ## [1] -0.05905503 cor(df$time, sample(df$score)) # r = -0.06 ## [1] -0.4665168 cor(df$time, sample(df$score)) # r = 0.15 ## [1] -0.435933 As you can see, the more shuffles we do, we get varied values of r. What we really should do is perform 10,000 (or another really high number) shuffles of the score variable and re-calculate r against the time variable for all 10,000 of these shuffles. Don't worry about the code below, but that's exactly what we're doing. We're saving the r values from the 10,000 shuffles in the object called results. results &lt;- vector(&#39;list&#39;,10000) for(i in 1:10000){ results[[i]] &lt;- cor(df$time, sample(df$score)) } head(unlist(results)) # this are the correlations for the first 6 of 10,000 shuffles ## [1] 0.274190962 0.005288304 -0.114492469 -0.280528642 0.235874922 ## [6] 0.061278049 We can plot the results in a histogram, and also put a vertical line at 0.56 which was our original observed correlation between time and score from the raw unshuffled data. results.df &lt;- data.frame(x = unlist(results)) ggplot(results.df, aes(x)) + geom_histogram(color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;,fill=&quot;lightseagreen&quot;) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0.56, lwd=1, lty=2) + xlab(&quot;r&quot;) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. As you can see, there were a few shuffles (or permutations) that we got an r value of greater than 0.56, but not that many. In fact, we can directly calculate how many: sum(unlist(results) &gt; 0.56) #163 were greater. ## [1] 163 It turns out that 163 times out of 10,000 shuffles we got a r value of greater than 0.56. WE could calculate this as a proportion by dividing by 10,000: sum(unlist(results) &gt; 0.56) / 10000 #0.0163 ## [1] 0.0163 We can use this value as our p-value. Because it is relatively low, we could argue that we were very unlikely by chance alone to have got a r value of 0.56 from our data. This suggests that the correlation between time and score is significant. The advantages of running a permutation test is that it is free of the assumptions of normality for the Pearson's r correlation signifiance test. It's also a cool method, and pretty intuitive. "]
